(it doesnt have an active connection to the 6 of those, even if they are all on-line and reachable) is this normal? my test hidden service seems to still be accessible.whats the worse case scenario if most bridges go down? if all traffic goes through let say two remaining relays, will the hidden service be unavailable to some users or would tor route accordingly?that would probably allow to deanonimise the hidden service more easily for a global attacker or if im using malicious bridges, but are there any other drawbacks?if i add more than 6 bridges on my torrc file, my tor process will connect to more than 6 bridges and that would allow to connect to other relays if some goes down. would there be a security risk doing so, other than potentially adding a malicious bridge into the mix? is there an ideal number of bridges to use?as i see it, running all the bridges would be the only way to make sure that you connect to stable bridges. many servers would be needed and thats not a viable option for a small hobby site. any better option? criticism, advices, opinions and interesting links are welcome!",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1062223,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,None,151889,Hidden service using bridges.,65879

quoteany communication with the blackberry® devices is hybrid encrypted using the best pki methods. the usability of the devices remains unchanged. roll out and certificate management are fully automated and the private keys are stored securily on the device itself.features of the ennetcom mobile encryption gateway:    pki encrypted communication with bes hybrid message encryption (rsa1024, aes256)    automatic certificate management for pki    use of x.509 certificates    protection of s/mime meg attachments    multi-factor authentication to protect the private keys    over-the-air (ota) roll-out this last quoted item mentions 1024-bit rsa keys -- maybe this page just wasnt updated, or it refers to an older version of the software. use of x.509 certificates and ""over-the-air (ota) roll-out"" suggests centralized certificate and/or (possible) pgp encryption key  generation -- i dont know whether the processor in these phones is beefy enough to generate rsa keys on the actual phones hardware, but im beginning to think not. i would bet my last currency unit that the servers referred to in the story were the blackberry enterprise server (bes) server and/or the mobile encryption gateway (meg) server. in other words, this appears to be nothing more than just another hushmail-style clusterfuck -- or at least thats what im going to assume, until (more like if) i get information to the  contrary.  a side effect of this is that this story is going to be used by the police as propaganda in an effort to shake peoples confidence in pgp. zaphod",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1062281,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,payment services,151695,Law Enforcement Shuts Down Blackberry PGP Communication Network,115356

(as an aside: that any random fbi agent has the ability to learn someone’s personal cell phone number and use it — uninvited — is, in my opinion, extremely threatening and unacceptable.) he didn’t say what he wanted, only that he wanted to know how to contact her daughter. i was travelling (as always), and my mother didn’t have a phone number for me.i had already been in the process of moving, permanently, to germany, and had retained a german immigrations lawyer several months prior to these events. in late november, not knowing this had already been taking place, i returned to the us for two weeks to visit family and friends for the holidays, collect my remaining belongings, and make any needed long-term arrangements.word got to my lawyer in the us, who decided to call fbi special agent mark burnett, on that friday, saying that he represented me and my family. burnett said the fbi simply wanted to ask me some questions. my lawyer responded by stating that, as my invoked representation, all questions should be directed to him rather than to me or my family. the agent agreed, paused while some muffled male voices were heard in the background, and asked to call back in five minutes.five minutes later, burnett called back and said, “i don’t believe you actually represent her.”¹ burnett stated additionally that a phone call from me might suffice, but that the fbi preferred to meet with me in person. after a pause he said, “but… if we happen to run into her on the street, we’re gonna be asking her some questions without you present.”my lawyer and i discussed what the fbi could possibly want. theories ranged from attempted entrapment, to the recent and completely unethical carnegie mellon university (cmu) attacks on the live tor network, to a grand jury subpoena for someone else, to some shady request for a backdoor in some software i contribute to. we honestly could not come up with any coherent rationale for why the fbi would suddenly decide to come after me, as, to my knowledge, i have done nothing which should warrant any interest besides my contributions to open source encryption tools.in the case that they might have asked for a backdoor, i tried to distract myself from the overwhelming (i don’t think i’ve actually fully understood the word “overwhelming” before these events) stress.i still planned to continue moving, of course, but now things would need to go to different places, and by different means. i didn’t know if i’d be stopped at the us border, or even prevented entirely from leaving. i started having panic attacks, thinking that i’d need to get myself and literally every object, including electronics, that i cared about accross the border, knowing they’d have the ability to detain me and mess with my belongings for as long as they liked. every device i owned could be compromised, i’d lose all my data, my pictures of family and loved ones, fiction i’d wrote as a teenager, and lisp i’d wrote as a child. i’ll admit i actually cried, not knowing when i’d hug my mom again. i prepared myself mentally, trying to model every possible tactic the fbi could play and my planned response.if they ask for information on anyone else, or think i witnessed or committed some crime: i solemnly invoke my miranda rights. no joking. no snark. no fucking around. everyone knows you don’t talk to the police.if they want a backdoor, or some other extralegal information about users or systems, likewise: i’d ask for my lawyers and shut up.i didn’t talk to anyone who wasn’t already in regular contact with me, fearing i might endanger them — some thug might show up at their mom’s door or make some threats to their lawyers — and i didn’t want to risk harming people i care about. it hurt to not tell my friends what was happening. i felt gagged and frightened. i wanted to play chess in the park. i wanted to learn duets on the piano. i wanted to ride bicycles through the ancient groves in the park in the endless californian sunshine. i wanted to bring homemade vegan gluten-free brownies and stickers from collectives in france to my friends at the eff. to be selfish, i wanted to read the number theory papers i’d just downloaded and play with a new pairing-based cryptography library i’d just been given the source to, but i couldn’t do those things either, simply because i was too stressed out to think straight.i got absolutely no work done.²if you’re going to get arrested, you might as well look good and smile your brightest while doing so. in a blur of anxiety and self-consciousness, i bought a pair of blue-green aviators and matching blue-green lipstick. this will totally build rapport with my interlocutors, i told myself. they will have no alternative but to understand that i fight for the good guys, that they should immediately drop their badges and guns — but keep the aviators! — to join me to fight for the true cause and freedom!due to speak at several cryptographic conferences in europe, i flew from san francisco’s internation airport to brussels on the next monday evening, on the latest flight i could get. i had been advised by another lawyer that, “for the fbi, ‘quitting time’ means quitting. after 5 o’clock, you’re good; you can do whatever you want, party in the streets naked on lsd, and they won’t notice a thing.” i also booked a return flight (though i had no intention of using it, since i planned to live in germany) upon the advice of multiple lawyers. with printed out conference and speaking invites, blue-green aviators, and blue-green lipstick, i went to san francisco international airport expecting to be detained indefinitely and lose everything i cared about.nothing happened.i don’t understand this. the fbi is handed dhs flight records like they’re the morning edition. they should have known, when they knocked on my parents’ door, that no one would be home. they should have known when i would fly into san francisco, and they could have easily detained me then. they reasonably could have known, and potentially acted fast enough, to detain me when i left san francisco for brussels.once in germany, i proceeded to compile “the book” of documents necessary for obtaining an aufenthaltserlaubnis (roughly translated, “residence visa with permission to work certain jobs, e.g. as a contractor/freelancer”). my appointment was in early january. the day before my appointment, i spoke with my lawyer. he had received another call, this time from a fbi special agent kelvin porter in atlanta.    lawyer: hello?    agent: hello, this is special agent kelvin porter at the fbi field offices in atlanta. i’m calling concerning your client.    lawyer: yes. why are you trying to contact her?    agent: well… as before… we would strongly prefer to meet her in person. we have teams in los angeles, san francisco, chicago, new york, and atlanta keeping an eye out for her.    lawyer: your colleague mentioned last time that you would accept a phone call?    agent: we would strongly prefer to meet her in person. we… uh… have some documents we’d like her opinion on.    lawyer: umm…? what documents?    agent: anyway, if she’s available to meet with us, that would be great, thanks.it didn’t exactly help with the stress of applying for a residence visa to know that there were teams in five cities across america keeping an eye out for me. however, i’m glad to say that, the next day, my residence visa was approved. eight hours afterwards, my laywer received a voicemail saying:    agent: hello this is special agent kelvin porter, we spoke two days ago regarding your client. umm… well… so the situation with the documents… it’s umm… it’s all fixed. i mean, we would of course still be happy to meet with your client if she’s willing, but the problem has… uh… yeah… been fixed. and uh… yeah. just let us know if she wants to set up a meeting.admittedly, i can’t even begin to understand what was going on here. documents? was this attempted entrapment? or were they using this as bait to get me interested in meeting them, so that they could ask about something else? i mean, help me, please — i really don’t understand what the fbi’s strategy was here.or, are they retracting their previous position in order to entice me to return to the us? should i be worried about what happens to me when i return? why is the fbi trying to make a developer of an open source encryption tool feel unwelcome in their country of origin? should i try to get a different citizenship? is my family safe in the us? should i worry about the fbi raiding my parents’ house and shooting our family dog? should i worry about fbi agents stalking and harrassing my mother? is this really how the united states has decided to treat american tech workers? am i just the forerunner in a larger campaign by the fbi to personally go after developers of encryption software which annoys them?update: 2016-04-26the fbi has contacted my lawyer again. this time, they said, “she should meet with one of our agents in san francisco to talk. otherwise, are you the point of contact for serving a subpoena? she’s not the target of investigation, but, uh… we uh… need her to clear up her involvement or… uh… potential involvement in a matter.”in case the fbi is seeking data on tor users or tor bridges, and especially in case the subpoena turns out to be sealed or accompanied by an nsl: the original published contents of this post are archived as a pdf here, and the ripe160(sha256(pdf)) is equal to

time.for over a year, i have maintained a warrant canary which covers the case of law enforcement agencies serving me a subpoena for information about tor users or tor bridges.¹ my lawyer mentioned a legal technicality (which may or may not be actually legal because precedent is unclear): having a prior retainer to a defense lawyer in the united states does not mean that a lawyer can invoke the client’s miranda rights (i.e. the right to remain silent) for the client, but that the client may be technically required to personally invoke their own miranda rights.² dear fbi, for what it’s worth: technically, financially-speaking, we’re funded by the same government. you can view my current contract and pay here and you can subscribe to any of several mailing lists in order to track my development progress. you can also watch my commits in real time. you can literally see everything i do, who i work for, how much money i make, where i go, and probably a whole bunch of other data

delicious ""source g"" mdma.i actually have maybe .02g of it lying around somewhere...it was an extremely mellow and effervescent batch of mdma -- one we of this community, im sure, can appreciate.i, personally, am more of a fan of the speedier ""oh fuck"" pushy brown mdma, but this ranks up there with the best.the only concern i had with the order was internal stealth at the time, however jor addressed this on the old forums and im sure has implemented something better since that time.?february 17, 2014, i too ordered back from jor in sr 1. great products, packaging, stealth, friendly forum prescence etc etc. for an anonymnous internet vendor you can truly trust them to come through. havent ordered anything since they went bulk/ sr 2 but i imagine its the same level of professionalism.?february 17, 2014, made my first ever illicit online purchase from jor over a year ago. i also made my favourite purchase with them when i got the toc liquid. they have never been

never thought there would be vendors of such impeccable integrity. truly a pleasure.?march 07, 2014, i received my pack of bulk 2c-bs within about 10 days to a far away country. stealth was definitely

more than accomodating and i feel both of us has been equally unlucky as we have both lost time and money on this transaction.?june 19, 2014, it all worked out jor was timely in communicating back with me, and gave me all the info i needed to know that my pkg was indeed coming. well now the pkg has landed, very happy about stealth and it seems like the same source a as last time  i will update on weight and potency!thanks for sticking with me and coming through like always jor!?june 22, 2014, great news on the price drop! competition is a good thing!here is another little update about source a -the mdma goes straight black in less than a second with the marquis reagent kit test. potent, pure, wonderful! the crystals are darker this time, but still great clarity in certain parts. the crystal texture isnt like sand this time(brown sand), its more like a soft rock candy texture(translucent crystal where thin).the weight is on point, even hooked up a bit. i will be back for more, much more ?september 10, 2014,what a wonderful day, the lsd arrived and my oh my.product - 5/5 - prints are beautfiul! product is well laid and labeled accordingly  this is the best lsd deal i have

really has it down to a science, bravo! bravo!====thanks and praise once again my savior, getting scammed on the group buy was a considerable blow, but jor really does take care of his customers. i will be back and cannot wait to review more lsd and other products.one love,-cactus?october 05, 2014,i had a chance to drop two of jors 277ug highest grade stuff yesterday... and wowthese tabs are really extraordinary. they were a bit hard for me to place exactly. they seem like very high quality fluff. theres no real body load at all and they are deeply euphoric, but there is a pretty decent amount of mindmelding. the kind where you can stare a wall for a half hour with only a thought or two. i was pretty beat the whole time as well, the day kind of just got away from me and i did not get myself the proper food or water i should have, so this could have contributed to that.these tabs are the most visual lsd i have ever eat in my life. i was blown out of the water how intricate patterns were. rich, colorful, and full of details.these tabs provided such a full experience overall. i was still going when i woke up the next day, with visuals crazier than the last few trips ive had, 16 hours after dosing. these tabs are just amazingly strong, reminscent of toc, but better. i really want to eat alot of these sometime.these certainly arent the cleanest of the clean, but this crystal wins in another sense.. it is really standout from all the other lsd ive had this year. praise jesus! every tab i try from jor feels like way more than it is advertised as.truly a lovely, ultra fresh, lay.lsd dosage: a++lsd purity: a?november 08, 2014, about time i wrote a few lines here... i have had contact on and off with jesus for a very long time. as far as the products go: even with high standards, with no doubt, a+. this is confirmed by me and many others... both the lsd and the mdma are among the finest i personally have tasted, and that verdict is echoed by many with me. in fact most people who have tasted of what i have bought say its the best, cleanest and most uplifting and insightful lsd they have taken. same goes for the molly, although in my opinion high quality lsd seems to be more rare and is therefore more noteworthy.secondly, the service gets the same grade. we have had our share of misunderstandings and inconvieniences of that kind that you cant escape... and i am truly amazed at how far through troublesome orders that jesus will come through, always professional, polite and effective. some times i have written upwards of 10 mails and thought every time ""this is the one where he just leaves me stranded in this mess, it would be so easy for him"". but nope, he comes through every time.cant say enough good things about this vendor. i see no need what so ever to turn elsewhere for the services he provides.truly a vendor of holy status ?april 14, 2015, if youre looking for a reliable supply of lsd and mdma, look no further. thank you jor for the latest present much lovebb?april 27, 2015, im sure if you are at all familiar wit me you know i stock jors lsd. i recently just made an order for lsd + mdma.shipping time: fastest the lord has ever provided me with the sacred molescules, packaged professionally and discreetly, both products are overweight and are of extreme purity. this mdma is hands down the funkiest and best smelling/looking glorious bag of crystal i have ever had, and thats saying something.?may 04, 2015,jors service is irreproachable.we all agree that they set up new standards to the darknet.i remember buying toc as soon as it was available a couple years ago (or more now), and im humbled to still see them amongst us.you definitely know youre in good hands when you place your order with jor.thanks again for everything, say hi to your disciples for us would ya??may 31, 2015, received some of jors #1 crystal. ordering and communication with jor was splendid. fast responses to pms every time, very friendly guy and nice to work with. the product comes in a small plastic ziplock bag, a picture for the ones interested: http://anonfiles.co.uk/image.php?di=dszfa lot of the crystal sticks to the bag and wont come out keeping the bag upside down with shacking/rubbing etc. my solution for this was inserting 2 ml vodka into the bag, dissolve the left over crystal, and add this solution to the vial where the rest of the crystal was placed in. worked very well i think, pretty sure no product was left in the bag.there were no issues dissolving the crystal in 4 ml of vodka, it did take about 10 minutes of shaking, but no visible bits were left after that.no gloves or mask were used. i tried to pay attention to not touch my face with my hands, but somehow a threshold dose got ingested anyway. if you need to stay 100% sober, better use hands/mouth/nose protection will test the product in a couple weeks, looking forward to it!?june 01, 2015, reddit is a waste of time!my last order with jor went well and it was one of the best gears i have tried in recent times visually not too over whelming but oh my  it is trippy i took 250ug once in a public place last month and became god  a friend who was with me tripping took 150ug and had himself in diapers..he was flooding tears.   jor <3?june 02, 2015,just had the opportunity to eat 1 and 1/2 of the #1 110ug blotters.it was a phenomenal experience. my tolerance was near zero with no acid consumed in many months. phenethylamine psychedelics in the past month or so ...the experience far exceeded what i normally expect from 165ug, but perhaps that is mostly because of my sensitivity. very pleased with this lovely lsd.?june 16, 2015,jor is an allstar vendor, done 2+ transactions at ~2000$ per transaction with no problems. as far as reship, if its your first order, probably not... and that should be expected.you will be required to fe, because again jor is an allstar vendor..and most likely that water should work, but also distilled water from the store will too!?june 20, 2015, tried out the #1 last night, ~350 ug dose..holy fucking shitballs.. no words to describe..from the one looking out of these eyes to the same one looking out of your eyes; thank you jor for making this available, love you man!i am glorious!!?june 29, 2015, jor,i must say the wait was def worth it.that vial i made was very potent and clean, every drop was felt on some cosmiclevel. when i am able to afford .1g i will look no further than you ?july 01, 2015, got it, ordered 100mg, they sent me 101mg o.o awesome!!! layed well in 60/40 everclear/water mix, i had no murky liquid. put the ~100mg into x1200 drops, hoping to get around ~80ug drop.color = white , sparkly in the light. on a us label scale, id say its fluff > needlepoint. still epic:dstealth = 5/5 awesome!! it wouldve taken 3 days shipping if not for the delays, again sorry for being a sore in your butt jor!+1?july 01, 2015, jor has been nothing but professional, and

27mg. wont be able to try for a week or so, will post an actual review then. thanks jor! <3?july 02, 2015, ordered 25mg of #2 on 6/15. it arrived earlier today. waiting for my day off to break it down and try, cant wait. thanks ?july 05, 2015, well i did ~130mg of jors mdma at 10pm and an additional 70mg at t+90m.  parachuted, onset was a bit slower than usual, though i was quite tired.  things started rolling after about an hour.  from the redose onwards i was pretty set.  took 225ug of al-lad after t+6h.  went for a long walk, went in and out of sleep like three hours after taking the tabs.  kinda weird continually waking up tripping.  visuals were strange, they were not very pronounced at first but only started to get interesting at like hours 3-5.  i was a bit surprised by the lack of visuals with the dose i took.  maybe i always already too fucked with the lack of sleep and drugs.gd50 was great, enjoyed that.  listened to the dead, phish and sci all night and morning.good stuff.jor is an accommodating and solid vendor. what else can you say, praise jesus.?july 05, 2015, regarding #1: wow. jesus, just wow. rinsed the beaker i prepared my vials in. definitely at least 500ug, but probably closer to 700-1000. quite a night. started coming up within 15 minutes and was out of my mind within 90. my whole world fell apart - relationships between everything vanished and i didnt believe anyone or anything around me was real - and i had a really difficult time putting everything back together. im still processing two days later. i suppose you could say it was scary, but it wasnt a bad trip (well, not really, you know). it was wildly different than anything ive ever experienced (the highest doses ive ever taken previously were 400-450ug of ootps needlpoint a few different times). its really clean acid and i would encourage anyone interested to try it. im probably going to take a break from tripping for most of the summer, but im really glad i have these vials and look forward to processing what happened and exploring myself more. jor, i really appreciate you trusting me with this substance. stealth was great, shipping was quick, product was overweight, and quality was absolutely as advertised.?july 08, 2015, got my package in earlier then expected. the xtal was a beautiful silver, with a little surprise of 2 extra mgs. stealth was nice, nothing crazy, but effective. much respect for what jor is able to accomplish in this world. so he gets a very very solid 5/5 from me. if anyone is nervous about purchasing anything, you should feel comfortable with this top notch business professional. thanks.?july 21, 2015, happy to finally post my review of jors mdma. this is actually my second time placing an order for bulk-ish mdma from jor, but the first time was using an account with a different name on agora, so i cant really prove it.placed an order w/ jor through this forums pm system in late may, got a prompt response with clear instructions regarding where to send the coin, which usd/eur conversion to use, etc. jor is very pleasant and straightforward to deal with, just make sure to read his thread if its your first time ordering so that you understand shipping times, prices, etc.the mdma arrived within the expected delivery time range (wont get more specific for security) and the weight was on point. my previous order with jor had a decoy while this one didnt, but considering the origin and destination countries i wouldnt call this a problem (again, cant get more specific, but jors crew picked an origin that would almost certainly make it to my drop).the mdma was a medium-dark brown, a good mix of big rocks, slightly smaller rocks, and powdery rocks (the largest rock, which was a bunch of smaller rocks fused together, was 60g). this batch had a slightly stronger licorice smell. the previous batch i received was greyish with smaller rocks on average than this batch. both batches tested well w/ marquis, mecke, mandelin, simons. there was a strand of hair in the product - i was able to easily remove the hair from the product and dont consider this to be a big deal, but im trying to be as detailed as possible in this review.both batches of product i received were of a very high quality as qualitatively judged by many testers. experienced mdma users described this batch as very pure and incredible and my personal experience agrees with these descriptions.ill definitely be doing business with jor again. its possible to find similar product for a better price but i will happily pay extra for a consistently good product and the time of a vendor who cares about opsec. bulk mdma packages are tougher to conceal due to their weight and size so id much rather deal with a vendor who has been in the game for a long time and cares about opsec than save a few bucks and get a cd.?july 21, 2015, my batch smelled quite strong.  it was a more pungent smell than i had encountered previously, which had been perhaps a little softer.  though, i had quite a bit more quantity this time.i was quite satisfied with the product as well.  brown rocks.  from what i understand from jor, it is because they do not wash the product with acetone.the lack of opacity was the only thing that was visually off for me, though that was due to compression and dust being compressed on the rocks.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1062565,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,hacking tools,151917,jesusofrave || Reviews from Around the Web,74213
0,False,Marketplaces ->Vendor Review,,40,English,"the majestic garden reviews ?january 17, 2016,i ordered a g from jor over a month ago, and saw that he was honoring his 9500$ price/g for purchases ranging back up to 2 months. contacted him about it and he is sending me the difference in the price i paid than vs current price....wow!!! i think the positive that will come from his good will in price reduction and beyond is going to have far reaching effects to individuals worldwide. as he says, the l trade is more than just about the $$ profit, yet the $$ and the transformative experience that is lsd now being more accessible and incentivized should have big effects as we stroll along in 2016. hip hip hoorrayyyyyyyymany thanks to jor? january 24, 2016, got a touchdown this week on the #1 (500 mg). looks a lot cleaner than my last batch. last batch was very gray/silver. this batch is white/ slightly off white / gray undertones. was sparkly too.will let you guys know how my upgrade from 500 to 1 gram goes, sending the upgrade dough to jor this coming week?january 30, 2016, pack gracefully landed today  much love to the jor and much love to that very special someone who helped it get here ?january 06, 2016, sacraments have landed!looks beautiful - #1 - very fluffy off white/silver powder. may be overweight even but my scale is not precise enough to tell. stealth was excellent and quite funny as well, got a good chuckle out of it.took a little over a week to arrive domestic us, however this was a reship from an order i placed about 5 weeks ago. in my original order i did not specify a preference for it to be shipped from. my last order came us domestic so i kind of figured this would too. unfortunately jor informed me later that the us hub was dry at the time so this order was shipped from an eu country because no preference was stated(lesson learned). when the order reached the farther end of the standard shipping times jor released tracking to me but i was only able to track the package to when it left its origin country. i think due to the tracking used it was not possible to locate it once it entered the us. not sure what happened but still no sign of the eu package.but jor, being the god he is, offered to send a domestic reship and if the eu package arrives to pay for it later - and trust me, this is something i will honor if the eu package was just delayed and finally shows.jor will not let you down. very pleased once again even with the small hiccup. cant wait to lay this to paper?january 07, 2016, also had an order arrive in just over a week... xtal exactly as described above.... silvery almost shiny gray..... very beautiful!!!!! can wait to hear some feedback on this current #1 batch... thanks again jor  ?january 07, 2016,jesus of rave, is the name a testament to the character? yes, it fucking is.with a roll of the dice and the stakes very high on an initial investment to test the waters, the roll was not a 7. more like twinkly snake eyes with all my bets on double 1s. this man is the man (or lady). this team is the team.ordered up was an odd 454.545mg of #1 crystal. appearance was slightly silvery or possibly beige bordering on a grey color. order was placed just before the peak of the peak of the holiday shipping peak and was received on the 20th day, and that is counting holidays and sundays. so if i were to guess, i think that this would have made it in less time had it not been the largest holidays season of the year.so did i get my 454.545mg of #1 xtal? one analytical lab balance later and much meticulous and very annoying transferring from receptacle to receptacle later, the truth was exposed. here is how it was determined.bag and contents were weighed post-calibration of the analytical balance which has a repeatability of +/-100mcg (+/-0.1mg). the weight of the bag and contents were weighed three consecutive times. round #1, #2, and #3 respectably were 1005.223mg, 1005.234mg, and 1005.212mg for an average of 1005.223mg.after the contents were removed and the initial receptacle thoroughly washed with 95% etoh multiple times, the receptacle itself was again weighed with the same method described above. rounds #1, #2, and #3 respectably were 543.232mg, 543.211mg, and 543.230mg for an average receptacle weight of  543.224mg.average receptacle weight of 1005.223 minus empty receptacle weight of 543.224 = 461.999mg.so did i get my 454.545mg of #1 xtal? hell no i did not. i got 461.999mg of #1 xtal!!!!!!!after a tincture is created i will be dosing 250mcg to 300mcg with my significant other(s) and i will be returning to elaborate on that experience.i have also taken a high quality photo with a professional camera that used 5500 k temperature lighting and color/temp balanced to true to life in post. once i find a trustworthy onion file host i will upload it (suggestions please?).stealth was great and incorporated a decoy and was rather funny and fun! great stealth, i would feel completely comfortable receiving this package at my own home door with my own hands although i did not.in appearance i would like to add that this is reminiscent of hos berkely silver xtal. a venture into my cardiovascular system will provide extra notes.i am happy. folks, we are doing great!may the universe bless jor and all of his colleagues. they are heroes.~bf?january 09, 2016,thank you jor! this shipping time was amazing but not quite as amazing at the stealth! ive been recieving packages for 3 yrs and this is by far the best stealth i have ever seen!thank you jor! i will write a more detailed description when i try the product!?january 09, 2016,i received my order of xtal #1 today. shipping time was ~2.5 weeks us domestic, within the stated shipping times on jors profile. stealth was very good and made me laugh product looks great! i plan on making some vials sometime soon. i will update with a review of the product once i try it. i havent taken any lsd in over 4 months, so im very excited to give this a go! jors lsd has been phenomenal in the past and i have complete faith that itll be the same high quality as before.thank you jor for all that you do!?january 25, 2016,another successful land from jor of the #1  roughly 20days which is grand and stealth is tops.have not tested yet but sure it will be amazing like the last. got the silver/grey batch but what does colour mean now for a journey the weekend ahead !?january 29, 2016,received xtal from jor with 7 days shopping with domestic.  item looks great, and ill write a follow up review once ive tried the xtal:).thanks jor!?february 12, 2016, just placed an order through the webshop, worked like a charm   payment processing is quick, i can still login with pgp after logout, and also the order is still visible after logout/login.? february 12, 2016,order went smoothly, same process as pushingtabu.only issue i had was my order disappeared today, the status had changed over the past 2 days but wasnt there when i checked today.?february 12, 2016,took me too long to update this, but jor was very fast and the product was a beaut as always. this helped me a lot and i really do appreciate it?february 12, 2016, ordered 12/7, received today. quite the delay, but jor was very responsive to all my pms. looks like probably my package fell through the cracks - i do not believe it was lost in the mail or picked up by the police - so a reship was agreed upon +50%.obviously the delay wasnt ideal, but it was never going to be a week turn around. full respect and trust in this vendor! thanks for everything, jor.?march 02, 2016, i purchased lsd xtal for the first time and it couldnt have gone smoother.jor has great communication,reponded quickly to all messages.i ordered 25mg of #1 xtal and he sent 28mg.the new site is also really easy to use.thanks jor,peace?march 03, 2016, i just wanted to say that i placed an order on jors new site. it took a week and a half to receicve from a domestic hub. it was also overweight by 2mgs. i cant wait to place another order. the new site is great. thank you jor!?march 05, 2016,bought jor #1 25mg.after tguk falling out in had to find someone new. i used him because of his prices and strayed away from tmg for awhile. i came back and checked out the vendors and checked jor page like usual. he has a website with some awesome prices that i couldnt refuse haha.the xtal came in a week which surprised me but, it came at the perfect time.we make the liquid and do 2 drops each. after we drop we go outside and made a huge bonfire and ride around on tractors and watching the stars. we go back inside and the bed feels like we are sitting in the middle of the ocean.this trip though was probably the cleanest and clearest trip ive ever had. i guess getting the xtal and making liquid for the first time just added to the trip making it a whole new experience.definitely found who im staying with thank you jor!!?march 15, 2016, i received my xtal order today! it came in exactly 1 week. i was so excited when i saw it in my mail hole!i have ready on the internet that the xtal gives off a certain energy and you can feel it...i dont know if it was placebo, but i legitimately felt the energy. at first it almost felt like a comeup of a trip; i felt a sensation in my head and felt kind of giddy. twas an interesting phenomenon. has anyone else experienced this?cant wait to make some vials!?march 26, 2016, hi! i have received my order in the last weeks.the stealth was perfect, the shipping time was really fast, and the weight was at least on point!the #1 crystal is white, its really beautiful!the quality is really perfect, for me, its the perfect lsd!the feeling is really very very clean, just really only very good sensations!you are doing it really perfectly, providing the best molecule at the best price!!just a word to say, please, keep up the 1g listing!!!again, thanks really a lot for all, i wish you a lot of happiness! ?march 31, 2016, i ordered 50mg of the #1 xtal.it arrived in 14 days (not counting sundays). i was worried because of certain events that happened to a brother of mine involving the dnm and customs 0_0. i knew it was coming domestic but still paranoid when the 7 day mark passed. like jor site says they change things up (date it hit the post office on the letter) and it arrived safe and sound and better stealth than last time.thank you very much for upgrading everyones order you can definitely see a difference in the appearance of #1 and #5. i feel very blessed to be able to handle this divine sacrament and share it with others. i never thought id be able to handle it or every see the crystal in my life. after reading all the china cat stories xtal really interested me.planning on trying it this weekend when i dont have to work.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1062566,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,hacking tools,151917,jesusofrave || Reviews from Around the Web,74213
0,False,Marketplaces ->Vendor Review,,40,English,"the majestic garden reviews ?july 23, 2015, ordered 50mg of lsd xtal, was told i would hear what kind it is upon arrival.  requested either #2 or #4.  was told i recieved #4.crystal was a very nice white color with a slight white/silver tinge to it, was told it was the dutch #4.  was very surprised at the origin point - thought it would be international, but was maybe half a state over from where i was.  mustve been a reshipper.eitherway, i recieved 52mg of the crystal as was written on the package and didnt weigh it as it was too little and also lsd.  not my first time with crystal - this stuff looked a lot more silver-beige and less white then a lot of the other white crystals i have worked with and when i tested the lsd and broke it down in distilled water it was quite easy to tell there could have been a bit more cleaning done for this crystal.  when tested empirically at ~450ug, i found some quite noticeable muscle tension and stomach tension when coming up that was somewhat bothersome, but smoothed out around two hours into the trip.  per chance it was the very high dosage that gave the strong side effects, but who knows.  i am very sensitive to physical side effects from lsd, but i will say that by 3 hours in they were not bothering me at all anymore. the mental effects though were very clean and pronounced; hallucinations were full on, not just patterns, but full on real hallucinations of spiders and grasshoppers and creatures and magical fantasy hallucinations.  complete deep mental hallucinations involving those 4th dimensional and 5th dimensional epiphanies that completely change the way you see things, complete immersion in the trip, full on spirit contact - just a bit of physical side effects that couldnt be ignored.am not sure if i received the dutch silver on accident yet i was assured it was the dutch white.  i am used to working with so called ""needlepoint"" or ""upper white"" crystals so i do believe this dutch white to just be in the lower 90s in terms of percentage.  beautiful trip though.?august 08, 2015, ordered on the 25th of june arrived today so 43 days total however i think this was near the end of the shipping troubles and i think jor has fixed whatever was causeing this.communication was excellant throughout around the 28 day mark i got antsy that my pack might have been seized and jor provided me a tracking number.stealth was excellant value was excellant going to test the quality but i highly doubt it will be any less than excellant.my only complaint would be ship time and it seems that is resolved now ?august 13, 2015, the old deadheads partook in the mdma at phish a few days ago and loved it.  full steam ahead!?august 24, 2015,jesusofrave is a standup guy. i ordered blotters from him and i have nothing but positive things to say. shipping took around two weeks and stealth was good.being the first first time i took acid, i only took 60 ug (half a tab) in the morning and i was seeing effects all day long. very high quality stuff.jor is very responsive and does everything he can to make you happy. once again i cant say enough good things about him and his product.dont ever stop what youre doing!?september 01, 2015, latest #1 batch is quite lovely.very soft and relaxing, i was amazed out how it was not speedy at all, almostwas able to nod off actually, but cud not because my mind was racing so fast withideas and images.even after a long weekend of sampling various l at a festie, a bag and bowl lickhad me grinning all night. visuals were subtle, due to tolerance...but the energetic feeling and emotions were full on and long lasting.i gave a friend just one drop from a vial i made. he was in love. said it was very mental,abit visual,and the body feeling was ticklish and pleasant all over, with no aches or jaw issues.way to go jor!: d ?september 04, 2015, was able to try my last #1 order. seems to be the same quality as my first order, quality! dropped about 110 before i took my dog out for a walk about an hour later we were just sitting in the park and the trees were really starting to move. i mostly drop at night and havent been outside tripping it a while now - need to do it again soon. excited for the rinse ive saved up. the last jor rinse i did was by far the most intense experience of my life. it really grounded me. hoping to get it in in the next week. always, thank you jor.?september 04, 2015, you always manage to put a smile on my face jor.everyone around here loves your acid, my friends dont even believe me when i tell theyre only 110mic.props to the chemist.and to your disciples keep up the great work?september 06, 2015, first time trying #1:drank half of the 110 mg vial wash made with upw. face melted. completely clean high purity crystal. yoga beamed to me from universal conciousness. my glands have never felt so stimulated. no tension whatsoever. peaked about 3-5 hours in. could go to sleep any time after the peak. ive had order of the phoenix and tessellated this summer and the quality and potency of this blows them out of the water. have been experimenting with microdosing recently. this stuff is truly a gift ?september 06, 2015, i had some #1 & #2, went to a few festivals over the summer and things got weird everyone loves it and its some of the best lsd ive had from the dnm, and ive ordered from everybody. props to your chemist and you for taking the risk involved getting this to people. i have adhd and anxiety issues and your lsd doesnt seem to make me speedy at all, it actually helps me deal with it (accept it more & become less worried?) +1?september 06, 2015, the #1 is definitely very special  i ate a tiny bit off the tip of a needle and it gave me the strongest/and smoothest lsd experience i have ever had.  i was completely comfortable throughout the entire trip. i find the #1 to be very gentle and very smooth, it really encourages me to explore higher doses.i cant put into words how good this xtal is and how much i appreciate/admire what you and your team are doing... thank you so much! ?september 08, 2015,happy to report another successful mdma transaction with jor.product quality is excellent as always - marquis, mecke, mandelin, and simons reagent tests reacted as expected for mdma and multiple experienced users spoke very highly of the quality of the product. the product is the same brown sugar as before. shipping was within stated estimates and holy stealth was definitely used.this order was the first time i had to communicate with jor outside of the normal order-placing back-and-forth and i have to say that jors responsivenss and customer service were great. i pestered jor with some questions regarding his holy stealth methods and he was always happy to answer my questions quickly and informatively. there was a misunderstanding regarding the origin of the package which jor was quick to remedy satisfactorily.im definitely going to be placing more orders with jor in the future. theres something to be said about the reduced cognitive load that comes from working with a vendor renowned for security and quality, especially with border security becoming more annoying and bargain-priced vendors not paying enough attention to stealth.?september 09, 2015,ive only dealt with jor twice now but theyve been very quick to answer any questions, things have always arrived when expected, and the lsd has been very good. not much more you can ask for.ive had intense nausea but im fairly certain thats due to some recent psychological issues. besides that ive had some great trips and would 100% recommend.?september 09, 2015,ordered 25 mg of #1 xtal laid on 111 ug blotters, for a total of 225 blotters.received the order in 2 weeks which is very reasonable for my part of the world. stealth was perfectly adequate.i would like to commend jor for delivering beyond my expectations- quick communication- followed my request of no-print blotters- followed my request of shipping location- gave a few extras which is always welcomemost importantly the crystal itself deserves recognition. ive only had a few batches of xtal from the dnm, particularly meatballs underdosed tabs and ootps nowow and this is definitely the best ive tried.this crystal is absolutely amazing, 1 tab (with 2 week gap since my last trip) had me coming up in 20 mins and full blown tripping in an hour. after getting used to ootps acid, i had gotten used to tripping at home so i wasnt expecting too much, but this opened up my minds vistas in a very positive, spiritually enlightening way. i had some realizations about some bad habits that were affecting the people close to me and cried my hearts out and immediately made some concrete actions to change that.the trip seemed a bit short (6-7 hours) but i believe that could have been due to my physical constitution as i was feeling a bit sick at the time and because i peaked so hard so quickly. no regrets whatsoever.my biggest concern is actually spreading this love to friends since i think its so strong. most people i give a tab or half a tab of ootps nwow would already flip out so i plan on being extra careful about educating them of the potential benefits and dangers. to be honest, id rather sell just enough to make my money back so i could stash this xtal for as long as i can.thank you jor for this wonderful product and the benefits youve given and will give to me and my friends. you are doing the world a true service. ?september 21, 2015, ordered on day n, order arrived on day n+8 (including weekends and holidays, of which there were both in this particular span of time), somewhere in the eastern usa.stealth was great, came with a some very nice (and fitting) material, i’d have been happy to get the stealth material without the drugs, had i not paid to have drugs included.upon close inspection i had a small packet containing, hopefully, 10mg of relatively pure lsd. i verified weight by measuring the “full” bag vs. the “empty” and dried out bag. the bag came back weighing 10mg lighter than it started, so i will take that to mean that the bag had approximately 10mg of lsd contained within, and hence, measure that a success.i prepared the vial by placing my 10mg of lsd into an alcohol/distilled water solution. i did this with two syringes. i loaded a “clean” syringe with my alcohol/d-h2o mixture and put it in the bag with the lsd crystal and mixed it as well as i could, pulled that out with my “dirty” syringe to place into a vial. i repeated until 100ml had been collected and then did a thorough wash again of the bag/“dirty” syringe to save for a rainy day.i put a little bit of the solution onto two pieces of paper to test with both the erlich and marquis reagent tests. erlich should indicate the presence of indoles, so i either have lsd or a very minute amount of some other indole hallucinogen. i tested against marquis, specifically to ensure that there was no additional reaction that wouldn’t be expected, indicating the presence only of lsd rather than any adulterants. both tests came back as expected.now the fun part of the testing, the trials. i first took ~10µg just to ensure no negative reactions (not that i was expecting any from what by all current accounts is definitely lsd, but you never know). a week later i decided to go for a standard ~100µg dose.~100µg was clean, not speedy at all. i felt like i had energy to use, but i did not feel compelled or required to get up and use it, which was nice because i got to spend some time sitting down and meditating. this, in contrast to almost all other lsd i’ve had, was amazing. i’m used to getting fairly amped up and feeling like i’ve got way too much energy to spare. the visuals were nice, not overly powerful, drifting, some tracers, colors were definitely enhanced as well. going for a walk there were several points where it looked as if the entirety of my visual field was a painting, which was definitely cool as i progressed through the scene by walking. i, however, had few if any cevs and ego death definitely did not seem achievable at this dose.my biggest surprise, being that this is the first time i’ve been in control of the crystal that was used to make my dose, is that 100µg is powerful, but completely controllable (for me). the headspace is definitely different from normal waking consciousness but not over powering like i’ve experienced on presumably higher dosed trips. i wasn’t sure how well i’d be able to communicate or just in general control some aspects of the trip at the start, but it was very mild in intensity and very awesome nevertheless.i will definitely repeat this experience, though i’m also curious to try out some of the other milestone doses that i ordinarily would just have to take on faith were accurate when given to me in the past.bottom line: awesome product, great vendor, will definitely go this route in the future.?october 06, 2015, well i guess this has been coming for some time now...in the beginning there was grey, then mostly off white with black dimers, and now things are white.  the improvement has been quite obvious.  when it goes into the solvent the solvent doesnt discolor darker, but becomes milky and settles to clear shortly thereafter.  you may notice some harder white grains that are probably seed crystal but they go into solution if crushed.  all parties report back the same results- excellent transaction.   due to the price point and quality of product this vendor cannot be beat.speed a+stealth a+communication a+weight a+quality a+   ?november 13, 2015, recently recieved my first package from jor. first time laying product so i got 25mg as a test run. laid 250 tabs aiming for 100ug. at first, i was a little worried because with such a small amount, most of it was stuck to the bag. however, mixing the solution in the bag turned out being quite simple and i thought i did a good job making sure to get everything from the bag with a couple extra washes.laying them went pretty smoothly, i doubled the solution to make two passes, figuring if i were to have runoff, i would lose less with a more diluted solution. turned out having very little runoff at all, after checking the tray with black light afterward there was definitely some product there, but ill just save that for myself.  anyway, i feel like im wasting your time with this so ill get to what matters:jors #1 was even better than i expected! i think im a fairly experienced user(50+ trips), i wont go into a full blown trip report but i found jors #1 to be a very visually pleasing trip, with a great headspace and little to no body tension. i have no experience that i could say was better. i was quite surprised at the strength of the tabs i laid, figuring i must have lost some potency through the bag, runoff, and mixing container. these tabs were every bit of 100ug. there may have been hot spots but i have yet to hear from someone that didnt love them. all in all, im more than pleased and had to come back to praise the savior. cant wait to grab more!?november 14, 2015, another successful order with jor, the xtal #1 is beautiful as always.... the service and communication ....excellent!!!!! thanks again!!!?november 16, 2015, the light shone down on me today once again. took about two weeks. nothing but amazing things to say, as usual.thanks, jesus!?november 13, 2015, recently recieved my first

white (rather grey) and on that alone better fits the description of xtal 3.  jor assures me that its just a different batch from the same xtal 1 source and not to be fooled by the color.  in many respects it seems a bit twitchy to be worried about which excellent xtal i have, im sure they are all good. however, some part of me wont stop wondering and a third party answer would be that much more reassuring than one from jor himself.i never really understood why xtals 3 and 4 get bought at all given the massively positive reviews of no 1 and 2. i suppose my worry is that they dont and jor

0,False,Marketplaces ->Vendor Review,,40,English,"product :   mushrooms b+ / 4,5gappearance:  whole mushroomsthe mushrooms were cracker dry and besides a few broken stems , they looked absolutely gorgeous.big fruit bodies with golden brown shimmering caps and faintly blue bruised stems, just like they are supposed to look. i was so happy when i finally held these babies in my hands, since the netherlands banned mushrooms from the smart-shops and left us with sclerotia or so called truffles.if you think that mushrooms taste bad, you have no idea what these truffles are like. they might have the same effects but truffles are like chewing up unripe walnuts that turn to a sour mush in you mouth. they actually have me gag when i try to eat them.i started my preparation routine for my trip: besides fasting for at least 12h prior ingestion, i have to clean up the place. and i mean ritz carlton presidential suit clean. after that i wash myself and set a playlist for the trip, while i try to get my head clean. what do i want to ask the mushroom? what do i want to gain or lose by this trip? or do i maybe just want to have a good time and enjoy myself, like this time? i don´t know if you have any rituals or routines, but i believe that they give you a certain type of grounding, which can be very helpful at deeper trip stages. i don´t see psychedelics just as another type of drug but as tools, that deserve a special type of respect. you can benefit a lot from them, but you can also have hell on earth. believe me.when the time came, i put one the music, took some antihistamines to counteract the nausea and started chewing up the mushrooms. one by one, with a small piece of black chocolate.i then proceeded to grind up some bud, prepare a few joints and put the rest on the side to smoke some pipes. in the meantime, my body already started to feel strange. mushrooms give me a different type of body feeling. first you start to feel somewhat detached from yourself and your surroundings. then, while the trip progresses, you start to change into a gummy boned, lethargic blob.i layed back on my bed and watched the colour of the room change from normal to sepia/brown tones, while the wall started to breathe, melt and form faces.i  feel way more dreamy than on lsd, for example, which makes it easier to me to close my eyes an watch the beautiful civ develop from light shadows, into two dimensional patterns until they finally turn into three dimensional ever growing fractals. at this point, you usually don´t even care if you have your eyes closed  the music floods throug your whole body and changes your inner imagery. sometimes you might even feel like the music was especially written for you. or maybe the mushroom speaks to you through things you thought you knew, but rediscover in an absolutely different way. well i think i´m rambling again, so back to the point.i enjoyed the ride for a good 3+ hours before it slowly decended into a mellow comedown, that lasted another 2 hours. i found, that if you smoke some pot at this point, it will get you back a little deeper the trip.i also like to watch some trippy animations or fractals etc. and just smoke until i fall asleep to some nice chillout music.conclusion:very nice, social mushroom. the dose of 3,5-4g is actually quite nice to chill out and should not cause you ego loss, but i believe that a good 7 grams will whoop your ass.i think i will come back and order the big pack to grind up and soak in alcohol for some blue dragon extract review on that follows.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1062583,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,hacking tools,151912,GoldenCamel *dutch vendor* review,82172
0,False,Marketplaces ->Vendor Review,,40,English,"product :   indoor shakeappearance:   grinded bud and leafsmell:      sweet/sour the product was grinded, so i cannot say how the ratio of bud to leaf with this product is.but since i turn my shake mostly into hash or oil, i have a pretty good estimation of its quality.the smell is not too leafy with a slightly sweet and sour profile to it like power-plant or sth like that, but i don´t want to guess here. it can also be a mix of different shake, which you get mostly with shake. you could probably smoke it as it comes if you are on a budget or maybe use it to mix with some of your bud. it might add a nice flavor and definitely makes your stash last longer.of course, you could do what i did and turn it into bho (sorry, but i´m too lazy to make ice hash atm).i think most of you are familiar with the procedure,  so i will not go into detail here.after about an hour and a half of freezing, blasting and pre-purging, i was looking at the last few bubbles hardening up in the gold shimmering surface of my beloved extract.i was left with about 2,35g of stable, deep golden extract. it came out as actual shatter.when i tried to scrape it from the pyrex dish, the first inch of my product shattered in a thousand little pieces. lucky enough, the walls were high enough, so that nothing landed on the floor. the short moment of shock turned into joy.it had a the smell profile but with much more intensity and this certain smell that only bho has. i don´t know if it’s the thc im smelling, but i sure like to think so.so i got out the bubbler again and began torching away. the taste is the same as the smell but also has a lot musk to it. i wonder if that only comes from turning it into bho or if the material itself has this hidden quality. at this point i´m thinking that i should have put at least a little into my vaporizer to see how it would have worked here.well the high hits you instantly with a lot party in your head feeling. it doesn´t hit too hard on the body, so it´s not a night time smoke but if would definitely advise you not to smoke it when you have to do something important. conclusion:interesting but familiar smell , especially for a budget smoke. with a little effort, you can also treat yourself and turn this into a fine extract.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1062584,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,hacking tools,151912,GoldenCamel *dutch vendor* review,82172

have one at all -- i dont. i absolutely refuse to have one of the damned things, and i refuse to carry one. this is something that, eric blair, writing as george orwell, could never have foreseen -- he could never have imagined a world where people buy their own surveillance devices, slavishly carry them everywhere, and then pay through the nose for their ongoing maintenance. were like rats who have undergone operant conditioning -- we have to be within reach of our devices, at all hours of the day and night, to the point where people now report symptoms of anxiety when separated from their devices. among other things, this conditioning has gotten us to the point that we now, by and large, expect instant responses to our messages -- thats why instant messengers have become so popular, because people have come to expect, and even demand immediate feedback, or responses. that is why barrett brown is spending the next 10 years or so in jail, because he thoughtlessly blurted out somehting he shouldnt have in a chat session with fbi rat/snitch hector monsegur (sabu). the saddest story i can recall reading was about a man who was driving home late at night -- his wife texted him to ""drive safely! -- when the device beeped upon receiving her text message, he automatically reached for the device, taking his eyes off the road. he lost control of the car, and died after

2014 follow @craigtimberghttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/for-sale-systems-that-can-secretly-track-where-cellphone-users-go-around-the-globe/2014/08/24/f0700e8a-f003-11e3-bf76-447a5df6411f_story.htmlmakers of surveillance systems are offering governments across the world the ability to track the movements of almost anybody who carries a cellphone, whether they are blocks away or on another continent.the technology works by exploiting an essential fact of all cellular networks: they must keep detailed, up-to-the-minute records on the locations of their customers to deliver calls and other services to them. surveillance systems are secretly collecting these records to map people’s travels over days, weeks or longer, according to company marketing documents and experts in surveillance technology.the world’s most powerful intelligence services, such as the national security agency and britain’s gchq, long have used cellphone data to track targets around the globe. but experts say these new systems allow less technically advanced governments to track people in any nation — including the united states — with relative ease and precision.users of such technology type a phone number into a computer portal, which then collects information from the location databases maintained by cellular carriers, company documents show. in this way, the surveillance system learns which cell tower a target is currently using, revealing his or her location to within a few blocks in an urban area or a few miles in a rural one.it is unclear which governments have acquired these tracking systems, but one industry official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive trade information, said that dozens of countries have bought or leased such technology in recent years. this rapid spread underscores how the burgeoning, multibillion-dollar surveillance industry makes advanced spying technology available worldwide.“any tin-pot dictator with enough money to buy the system could spy on people anywhere in the world,” said eric king, deputy director of privacy international, a london-based activist group that warns about the abuse of surveillance technology. “this is a huge problem.”security experts say hackers, sophisticated criminal gangs and nations under sanctions also could use this tracking technology, which operates in a legal gray area. it is illegal in many countries to track people without their consent or a court order, but there is no clear international legal standard for secretly tracking people in other countries, nor is there a global entity with the authority to police potential abuses.in response to questions from the washington post this month, the federal communications commission said it would investigate possible misuse of tracking technology that collects location data from carrier databases. the united states restricts the export of some surveillance technology, but with multiple suppliers based overseas, there are few practical limits on the sale or use of these systems internationally.“if this is technically possible, why couldn’t anybody do this anywhere?” said jon peha, a former white house scientific adviser and chief technologist for the fcc who is now an engineering professor at carnegie mellon university. he was one of several telecommunications experts who reviewed the marketing documents at the post’s request.“i’m worried about foreign governments, and i’m even more worried about non-governments,” peha said. “which is not to say i’d be happy about the nsa using this method to collect location data. but better them than the iranians.”‘locate. track. manipulate.’location tracking is an increasingly common part of modern life. apps that help you navigate through a city or find the nearest coffee shop need to know your location. many people keep tabs on their teenage children — or their spouses — through tracking apps on smartphones. but these forms of tracking require consent; mobile devices typically allow these location features to be blocked if users desire.tracking systems built for intelligence services or police, however, are inherently stealthy and difficult — if not impossible — to block. private surveillance vendors offer government agencies several such technologies, including systems that collect cellular signals from nearby phones and others that use malicious software to trick phones into revealing their locations.governments also have long had the ability to compel carriers to provide tracking data on their customers, especially within their own countries. the national security agency, meanwhile, taps into telecommunication-system cables to collect cellphone location data on a mass, global scale.but tracking systems that access carrier location databases are unusual in their ability to allow virtually any government to track people across borders, with any type of cellular phone, across a wide range of carriers — without the carriers even knowing. these systems also can be used in tandem with other technologies that, when the general location of a person is already known, can intercept calls and internet traffic, activate microphones, and access contact lists, photos and other documents.companies that make and sell surveillance technology seek to limit public information about their systems’ capabilities and client lists, typically marketing their technology directly to law enforcement and intelligence services through international conferences that are closed to journalists and other members of the public.yet marketing documents obtained by the washington post show that companies are offering powerful systems that are designed to evade detection while plotting movements of surveillance targets on computerized maps. the documents claim system success rates of more than 70 percent.a 24-page marketing brochure for skylock, a cellular tracking system sold by verint, a maker of analytics systems based in melville, n.y., carries the subtitle “locate. track. manipulate.” the document, dated january 2013 and labeled “commercially confidential,” says the system offers government agencies “a cost-effective, new approach to obtaining global location information concerning known targets.”the brochure includes screen shots of maps depicting location tracking in what appears to be mexico, nigeria, south africa, brazil, congo, the united arab emirates, zimbabwe and several other countries. verint says on its web site that it is “a global leader in actionable intelligence solutions for customer engagement optimization, security intelligence, and fraud, risk and compliance,” with clients in “more than 10,000 organizations in over 180 countries.”(privacy international has collected several marketing brochures on cellular surveillance systems, including one that refers briefly to skylock, and posted them on its web site. the 24-page skylock brochure and other material was independently provided to the post by people concerned that such systems are being abused.)verint, which also has substantial operations in israel, declined to comment for this story. it says in the marketing brochure that it does not use skylock against u.s. or israeli phones, which could violate national laws. but several similar systems, marketed in recent years by companies based in switzerland, ukraine and elsewhere, likely are free of such limitations.at the post’s request, telecommunications security researcher tobias engel used the techniques described by the marketing documents to determine the location of a post employee who used an at&t phone and consented to the tracking. based only on her phone number, engel found the post employee’s location, in downtown washington, to within a city block — a typical level of precision when such systems are used in urban areas.“you’re obviously trackable from all over the planet if you have a cellphone with you, as long as it’s turned on,” said engel, who is based in berlin. “it’s possible for almost anyone to track you as long as they are willing to spend some money on it.”at&t declined to comment for this story.exploiting the ss7 networkthe tracking technology takes advantage of the lax security of ss7, a global network that cellular carriers use to communicate with one another when directing calls, texts and internet data.the system was built decades ago, when only a few large carriers controlled the bulk of global phone traffic. now thousands of companies use ss7 to provide services to billions of phones and other mobile devices, security experts say. all of these companies have access to the network and can send queries to other companies on the ss7 system, making the entire network more vulnerable to exploitation. any one of these companies could share its access with others, including makers of surveillance systems.the tracking systems use queries sent over the ss7 network to ask carriers what cell tower a customer has used most recently. carriers configure their systems to transmit such information only to trusted companies that need it to direct calls or other telecommunications services to customers. but the protections against unintended access are weak and easily defeated, said engel and other researchers.by repeatedly collecting this location data, the tracking systems can show whether a person is walking down a city street or driving down a highway, or whether the person has recently taken a flight to a new city or country.“we don’t have a monopoly on the use of this and probably can be sure that other governments are doing this to us in reverse,” said lawyer albert gidari jr., a partner at perkins coie who specializes in privacy and technology.carriers can attempt to block these ss7 queries but rarely do so successfully, experts say, amid the massive data exchanges coursing through global telecommunications networks. p1 security, a research firm in paris, has been testing one query commonly used for surveillance, called an “any time interrogation” query, that prompts a carrier to report the location of an individual customer. of the carriers tested so far, 75 percent responded to “any time interrogation” queries by providing location data on their customers. (testing on u.s. carriers has not been completed.)“people don’t understand how easy it is to spy on them,” said philippe langlois, chief executive of p1 security.the gsma, a london-based trade group that represents carriers and equipment manufacturers, said it was not aware of the existence of tracking systems that use ss7 queries, but it acknowledged serious security issues with the network, which is slated to be gradually replaced over the next decade because of a growing list of security and technical shortcomings.“ss7 is inherently insecure, and it was never designed to be secure,” said james moran, security director for the gsma. “it is possible, with access to ss7, to trigger a request for a record from a network.”the documents for verint and several other companies say that the surveillance services are intended for governments and that customers must abide by laws regarding their use. yet privacy advocates and other critics say the surveillance industry is inherently secretive, poorly regulated and indiscriminate in selecting its customers, sometimes putting profoundly intrusive tools into the hands of governments with little respect for human rights or tolerance of political dissent.refining the techniquesengel, the german telecommunications security researcher, was the first to publicly disclose the ability to use carrier networks to surreptitiously gather user location information, at a 2008 conference sponsored by the chaos computer club, a hacker activist group based in germany. the techniques engel used that day were far cruder than the ones used by today’s cellular tracking systems but still caused a stir in the security community.from the lectern, he asked for help from a volunteer from the audience. a man in an untucked plaid shirt ambled up with his cellphone in one hand and a beer in the other. engel typed the number into his computer, and even though it was for a british phone, a screen at the front of the room soon displayed the current location — in berlin.two years later, a pair of american telecommunications researchers expanded on engel’s discovery with a program they called “the carmen sandiego project,” named after a popular educational video game and television series that taught geography by having users answer questions.researchers don bailey and nick depetrillo found that the rough locations provided by engel’s technique could be mixed with other publicly available data to better map the locations of users. they even accessed the video feeds of highway cameras along interstate 70 in denver to gain a clearer picture of targeted cellphone users.“we could tell that they were going a certain speed on i-70,” bailey recalled. “not only could you track a person, you could remotely identify a car and who was driving.”an official for at&t, patrick mccanna, was in the audience when depetrillo and bailey presented their findings at a conference in 2010. mccanna praised the researchers for their work, they later said, and recruited their help to make it harder to gather location data.many of the world’s largest cellular networks made similar efforts, though significant loopholes remained.as some carriers tightened their defenses, surveillance industry researchers developed even more effective ways to collect data from ss7 networks. the advanced systems now being marketed offer more-precise location information on targets and are harder for carriers to detect or defeat.telecommunications experts say networks have become so complex that implementing new security measures to defend against these surveillance systems could cost billions of dollars and hurt the functioning of basic services, such as routing calls, texts and internet to customers.“these systems are massive. and they’re running close to capacity all the time, and to make changes to how they interact with hundreds or thousands of phones is really risky,” said bart stidham, a longtime telecommunications system architect based in virginia. “you don’t know what happens.”paired up with ‘catchers’companies that market ss7 tracking systems recommend using them in tandem with “imsi catchers,” increasingly common surveillance devices that use cellular signals collected directly from the air to intercept calls and internet traffic, send fake texts, install spyware on a phone, and determine precise locations.imsi catchers — also known by one popular trade name, stingray — can home in on somebody a mile or two away but are useless if a target’s general location is not known. ss7 tracking systems solve that problem by locating the general area of a target so that imsi catchers can be deployed effectively. (the term “imsi” refers to a unique identifying code on a cellular phone.)the fcc recently created an internal task force to study misuse of imsi catchers by criminal gangs and foreign intelligence agencies, which reportedly have used the systems to spy on american citizens, businesses and diplomats. it is legal for law enforcement agencies in the united states to use imsi catchers for authorized purposes.when asked by the post about systems that use ss7 tracking, fcc spokeswoman kim hart said, “this type of system could fall into the category of technologies that we expect the fcc’s internal task force to examine.”the marketing brochure for verint’s skylock system suggests using it in conjunction with verint’s imsi catcher, called the engage gi2. together, they allow government agencies “to accurately pinpoint their suspect for apprehension, making it virtually impossible for targets to escape, no matter where they reside in the world.”verint can install skylock on the networks of cellular carriers if they are cooperative — something that telecommunications experts say is common in countries where carriers have close relationships with their national governments. verint also has its own “worldwide ss7 hubs” that “are spread in various locations around the world,” says the brochure. it does not list prices for the services, though it says that verint charges more for the ability to track targets in many far-flung countries, as opposed to only a few nearby ones.among the most appealing features of the system, the brochure says, is its ability to sidestep the cellular operators that sometimes protect their users’ personal information by refusing government requests or insisting on formal court orders before releasing information.“in most cases mobile operators are not willing to cooperate with operational agencies in order to provide them the ability to gain control and manipulate the network services given to its subscribers,” the brochure says. “verint’s skylock is a global geo-location solution which was designed and developed to address the limitations mentioned above, and meet operational agency requirements.”another company, defentek, markets a similar system called infiltrator global real-time tracking system on its web site, claiming to “locate and track any phone number in the world.”the site adds: “it is a strategic solution that infiltrates and is undetected and unknown by the network, carrier, or the target.”the company, which according to the web site is registered in panama city, declined to comment for this story.follow the post’s tech blog, the switch, where technology and policy connect.craig timberg is a national technology reporter for the post.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1062718,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,hacking tools,151685,Leave your bloody cellphone at home!,115356

(the term is short for signaling system 7 and replaced previous networks called ss6, ss5, etc.)the researchers did not find evidence that their latest discoveries, which allow for the interception of calls and texts, have been marketed to governments on a widespread basis. but vulnerabilities publicly reported by security researchers often turn out to be tools long used by secretive intelligence services, such as the national security agency or britain’s gchq, but not revealed to the public.“many of the big intelligence agencies probably have teams that do nothing but ss7 research and exploitation,” said christopher soghoian, principal technologist for the aclu and an expert on surveillance technology. “they’ve likely sat on these things and quietly exploited them.”the gsma, a global cellular industry group based in london, did not respond to queries seeking comment about the vulnerabilities that nohl and engel have found. for the post’s article in august on location tracking systems that use ss7, gsma officials acknowledged problems with the network and said it was due to be replaced over the next decade because of a growing list of security and technical issues.the german researchers found two distinct ways to eavesdrop on calls using ss7 technology. in the first, commands sent over ss7 could be used to hijack a cell phone’s “forwarding” function -- a service offered by many carriers. hackers would redirect calls to themselves, for listening or recording, and then onward to the intended recipient of a call. once that system was in place, the hackers could eavesdrop on all incoming and outgoing calls indefinitely, from anywhere in the world.the second technique requires physical proximity but could be deployed on a much wider scale. hackers would use radio antennas to collect all the calls and texts passing through the airwaves in an area. for calls or texts transmitted using strong encryption, such as is commonly used for advanced 3g connections, hackers could request through ss7 that each caller’s carrier release a temporary encryption key to unlock the communication after it has been recorded.nohl on wednesday demonstrated the ability to collect and decrypt a text message using the phone of a german senator, who cooperated in the experiment. but nohl said the process could be automated to allow massive decryption of calls and texts collected across an entire city or a large section of a country, using multiple antennas.“it’s all automated, at the push of a button,” nohl said. “it would strike me as a perfect spying capability, to record and decrypt pretty much any network… any network we have tested, it works.”those tests have included more than 20 networks worldwide, including t-mobile in the united states. the other major u.s. carriers have not been tested, though nohl and engel said it’s likely at least some of them have similar vulnerabilities. (several smartphone-based text messaging systems, such as apple’s imessage and whatsapp, use end-to-end encryption methods that sidestep traditional cellular text systems and likely would defeat the technique described by nohl and engel.)in a statement, t-mobile said: “t-mobile remains vigilant in our work with other mobile operators, vendors and standards bodies to promote measures that can detect and prevent these attacks.""the issue of cell phone interception is particularly sensitive in germany because of news reports last year, based on documents provided by former nsa contractor edward snowden, that a phone belonging to chancellor angela merkel was the subject of nsa surveillance. the techniques of that surveillance have not become public, though nohl said that the ss7 hacking method that he and engel discovered is one of several possibilities.u.s. embassies and consulates in dozens of foreign cities, including berlin, are outfitted with antennas for collecting cellular signals, according to reports by german magazine der spiegel, based on documents released by snowden. many cell phone conversations worldwide happen with either no encryption or weak encryption.the move to 3g networks offers far better encryption and the prospect of private communications, but the hacking techniques revealed by nohl and engel undermine that possibility. carriers can potentially guard their networks against efforts by hackers to collect encryption keys, but it’s unclear how many have done so. one network that operates in germany, vodafone, recently began blocking such requests after nohl reported the problem to the company two weeks ago.nohl and engel also have discovered new ways to track the locations of cell phone users through ss7. the post story, in august, reported that several companies were offering governments worldwide the ability to find virtually any cell phone user, virtually anywhere in the world, by learning the location of their cell phones through an ss7 function called an “any time interrogation” query.some carriers block such requests, and several began doing so after the post’s report. but the researchers in recent months have found several other techniques that hackers could use to find the locations of callers by using different ss7 queries. all networks must track their customers in order to route calls to the nearest cellular towers, but they are not required to share that information with other networks or foreign governments.carriers everywhere must turn over location information and allow eavesdropping of calls when ordered to by government officials in whatever country they are operating in. but the techniques discovered by nohl and engel offer the possibility of much broader collection of caller locations and conversations, by anyone with access to ss7 and the required technical skills to send the appropriate queries.“i doubt we are the first ones in the world who realize how open the ss7 network is,” engel said.secretly eavesdropping on calls and texts would violate laws in many countries, including the united states, except when done with explicit court or other government authorization. such restrictions likely do little to deter criminals or foreign spies, say surveillance experts, who say that embassies based in washington likely collect cellular signals.the researchers also found that it was possible to use ss7 to learn the phone numbers of people whose cellular signals are collected using surveillance devices. the calls transmit a temporary identification number which, by sending ss7 queries, can lead to the discovery of the phone number. that allows location tracking within a certain area, such as near government buildings.the german senator who cooperated in nohl’s demonstration of the technology, thomas jarzombek of merkel’s christian democratic union party, said that while many in that nation have been deeply angered by revelations about nsa spying, few are surprised that such intrusions are possible.“after all the nsa and snowden things we’ve heard, i guess nobody believes it’s possible to have a truly private conversation on a mobile phone,” he said. “when i really need a confidential conversation, i use a fixed-line” phone.craig timberg is a national technology reporter for the post.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1062720,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,hacking tools,151685,Leave your bloody cellphone at home!,115356

tracking works.by craig timberg august 24, 2014 follow @craigtimberghttps://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/for-sale-systems-that-can-secretly-track-where-cellphone-users-go-around-the-globe/2014/08/24/f0700e8a-f003-11e3-bf76-447a5df6411f_story.htmlmakers of surveillance systems are offering governments across the world the ability to track the movements of almost anybody who carries a cellphone, whether they are blocks away or on another continent.the technology works by exploiting an essential fact of all cellular networks: they must keep detailed, up-to-the-minute records on the locations of their customers to deliver calls and other services to them. surveillance systems are secretly collecting these records to map people’s travels over days, weeks or longer, according to company marketing documents and experts in surveillance technology.the world’s most powerful intelligence services, such as the national security agency and britain’s gchq, long have used cellphone data to track targets around the globe. but experts say these new systems allow less technically advanced governments to track people in any nation — including the united states — with relative ease and precision.users of such technology type a phone number into a computer portal, which then collects information from the location databases maintained by cellular carriers, company documents show. in this way, the surveillance system learns which cell tower a target is currently using, revealing his or her location to within a few blocks in an urban area or a few miles in a rural one.it is unclear which governments have acquired these tracking systems, but one industry official, speaking on the condition of anonymity to share sensitive trade information, said that dozens of countries have bought or leased such technology in recent years. this rapid spread underscores how the burgeoning, multibillion-dollar surveillance industry makes advanced spying technology available worldwide.“any tin-pot dictator with enough money to buy the system could spy on people anywhere in the world,” said eric king, deputy director of privacy international, a london-based activist group that warns about the abuse of surveillance technology. “this is a huge problem.”security experts say hackers, sophisticated criminal gangs and nations under sanctions also could use this tracking technology, which operates in a legal gray area. it is illegal in many countries to track people without their consent or a court order, but there is no clear international legal standard for secretly tracking people in other countries, nor is there a global entity with the authority to police potential abuses.in response to questions from the washington post this month, the federal communications commission said it would investigate possible misuse of tracking technology that collects location data from carrier databases. the united states restricts the export of some surveillance technology, but with multiple suppliers based overseas, there are few practical limits on the sale or use of these systems internationally.“if this is technically possible, why couldn’t anybody do this anywhere?” said jon peha, a former white house scientific adviser and chief technologist for the fcc who is now an engineering professor at carnegie mellon university. he was one of several telecommunications experts who reviewed the marketing documents at the post’s request.“i’m worried about foreign governments, and i’m even more worried about non-governments,” peha said. “which is not to say i’d be happy about the nsa using this method to collect location data. but better them than the iranians.”‘locate. track. manipulate.’location tracking is an increasingly common part of modern life. apps that help you navigate through a city or find the nearest coffee shop need to know your location. many people keep tabs on their teenage children — or their spouses — through tracking apps on smartphones. but these forms of tracking require consent; mobile devices typically allow these location features to be blocked if users desire.tracking systems built for intelligence services or police, however, are inherently stealthy and difficult — if not impossible — to block. private surveillance vendors offer government agencies several such technologies, including systems that collect cellular signals from nearby phones and others that use malicious software to trick phones into revealing their locations.governments also have long had the ability to compel carriers to provide tracking data on their customers, especially within their own countries. the national security agency, meanwhile, taps into telecommunication-system cables to collect cellphone location data on a mass, global scale.but tracking systems that access carrier location databases are unusual in their ability to allow virtually any government to track people across borders, with any type of cellular phone, across a wide range of carriers — without the carriers even knowing. these systems also can be used in tandem with other technologies that, when the general location of a person is already known, can intercept calls and internet traffic, activate microphones, and access contact lists, photos and other documents.companies that make and sell surveillance technology seek to limit public information about their systems’ capabilities and client lists, typically marketing their technology directly to law enforcement and intelligence services through international conferences that are closed to journalists and other members of the public.yet marketing documents obtained by the washington post show that companies are offering powerful systems that are designed to evade detection while plotting movements of surveillance targets on computerized maps. the documents claim system success rates of more than 70 percent.a 24-page marketing brochure for skylock, a cellular tracking system sold by verint, a maker of analytics systems based in melville, n.y., carries the subtitle “locate. track. manipulate.” the document, dated january 2013 and labeled “commercially confidential,” says the system offers government agencies “a cost-effective, new approach to obtaining global location information concerning known targets.”the brochure includes screen shots of maps depicting location tracking in what appears to be mexico, nigeria, south africa, brazil, congo, the united arab emirates, zimbabwe and several other countries. verint says on its web site that it is “a global leader in actionable intelligence solutions for customer engagement optimization, security intelligence, and fraud, risk and compliance,” with clients in “more than 10,000 organizations in over 180 countries.”(privacy international has collected several marketing brochures on cellular surveillance systems, including one that refers briefly to skylock, and posted them on its web site. the 24-page skylock brochure and other material was independently provided to the post by people concerned that such systems are being abused.)verint, which also has substantial operations in israel, declined to comment for this story. it says in the marketing brochure that it does not use skylock against u.s. or israeli phones, which could violate national laws. but several similar systems, marketed in recent years by companies based in switzerland, ukraine and elsewhere, likely are free of such limitations.at the post’s request, telecommunications security researcher tobias engel used the techniques described by the marketing documents to determine the location of a post employee who used an at&t phone and consented to the tracking. based only on her phone number, engel found the post employee’s location, in downtown washington, to within a city block — a typical level of precision when such systems are used in urban areas.“you’re obviously trackable from all over the planet if you have a cellphone with you, as long as it’s turned on,” said engel, who is based in berlin. “it’s possible for almost anyone to track you as long as they are willing to spend some money on it.”at&t declined to comment for this story.exploiting the ss7 networkthe tracking technology takes advantage of the lax security of ss7, a global network that cellular carriers use to communicate with one another when directing calls, texts and internet data.the system was built decades ago, when only a few large carriers controlled the bulk of global phone traffic. now thousands of companies use ss7 to provide services to billions of phones and other mobile devices, security experts say. all of these companies have access to the network and can send queries to other companies on the ss7 system, making the entire network more vulnerable to exploitation. any one of these companies could share its access with others, including makers of surveillance systems.the tracking systems use queries sent over the ss7 network to ask carriers what cell tower a customer has used most recently. carriers configure their systems to transmit such information only to trusted companies that need it to direct calls or other telecommunications services to customers. but the protections against unintended access are weak and easily defeated, said engel and other researchers.by repeatedly collecting this location data, the tracking systems can show whether a person is walking down a city street or driving down a highway, or whether the person has recently taken a flight to a new city or country.“we don’t have a monopoly on the use of this and probably can be sure that other governments are doing this to us in reverse,” said lawyer albert gidari jr., a partner at perkins coie who specializes in privacy and technology.carriers can attempt to block these ss7 queries but rarely do so successfully, experts say, amid the massive data exchanges coursing through global telecommunications networks. p1 security, a research firm in paris, has been testing one query commonly used for surveillance, called an “any time interrogation” query, that prompts a carrier to report the location of an individual customer. of the carriers tested so far, 75 percent responded to “any time interrogation” queries by providing location data on their customers. (testing on u.s. carriers has not been completed.)“people don’t understand how easy it is to spy on them,” said philippe langlois, chief executive of p1 security.the gsma, a london-based trade group that represents carriers and equipment manufacturers, said it was not aware of the existence of tracking systems that use ss7 queries, but it acknowledged serious security issues with the network, which is slated to be gradually replaced over the next decade because of a growing list of security and technical shortcomings.“ss7 is inherently insecure, and it was never designed to be secure,” said james moran, security director for the gsma. “it is possible, with access to ss7, to trigger a request for a record from a network.”the documents for verint and several other companies say that the surveillance services are intended for governments and that customers must abide by laws regarding their use. yet privacy advocates and other critics say the surveillance industry is inherently secretive, poorly regulated and indiscriminate in selecting its customers, sometimes putting profoundly intrusive tools into the hands of governments with little respect for human rights or tolerance of political dissent.refining the techniquesengel, the german telecommunications security researcher, was the first to publicly disclose the ability to use carrier networks to surreptitiously gather user location information, at a 2008 conference sponsored by the chaos computer club, a hacker activist group based in germany. the techniques engel used that day were far cruder than the ones used by today’s cellular tracking systems but still caused a stir in the security community.from the lectern, he asked for help from a volunteer from the audience. a man in an untucked plaid shirt ambled up with his cellphone in one hand and a beer in the other. engel typed the number into his computer, and even though it was for a british phone, a screen at the front of the room soon displayed the current location — in berlin.two years later, a pair of american telecommunications researchers expanded on engel’s discovery with a program they called “the carmen sandiego project,” named after a popular educational video game and television series that taught geography by having users answer questions.researchers don bailey and nick depetrillo found that the rough locations provided by engel’s technique could be mixed with other publicly available data to better map the locations of users. they even accessed the video feeds of highway cameras along interstate 70 in denver to gain a clearer picture of targeted cellphone users.“we could tell that they were going a certain speed on i-70,” bailey recalled. “not only could you track a person, you could remotely identify a car and who was driving.”an official for at&t, patrick mccanna, was in the audience when depetrillo and bailey presented their findings at a conference in 2010. mccanna praised the researchers for their work, they later said, and recruited their help to make it harder to gather location data.many of the world’s largest cellular networks made similar efforts, though significant loopholes remained.as some carriers tightened their defenses, surveillance industry researchers developed even more effective ways to collect data from ss7 networks. the advanced systems now being marketed offer more-precise location information on targets and are harder for carriers to detect or defeat.telecommunications experts say networks have become so complex that implementing new security measures to defend against these surveillance systems could cost billions of dollars and hurt the functioning of basic services, such as routing calls, texts and internet to customers.“these systems are massive. and they’re running close to capacity all the time, and to make changes to how they interact with hundreds or thousands of phones is really risky,” said bart stidham, a longtime telecommunications system architect based in virginia. “you don’t know what happens.”paired up with ‘catchers’companies that market ss7 tracking systems recommend using them in tandem with “imsi catchers,” increasingly common surveillance devices that use cellular signals collected directly from the air to intercept calls and internet traffic, send fake texts, install spyware on a phone, and determine precise locations.imsi catchers — also known by one popular trade name, stingray — can home in on somebody a mile or two away but are useless if a target’s general location is not known. ss7 tracking systems solve that problem by locating the general area of a target so that imsi catchers can be deployed effectively. (the term “imsi” refers to a unique identifying code on a cellular phone.)the fcc recently created an internal task force to study misuse of imsi catchers by criminal gangs and foreign intelligence agencies, which reportedly have used the systems to spy on american citizens, businesses and diplomats. it is legal for law enforcement agencies in the united states to use imsi catchers for authorized purposes.when asked by the post about systems that use ss7 tracking, fcc spokeswoman kim hart said, “this type of system could fall into the category of technologies that we expect the fcc’s internal task force to examine.”the marketing brochure for verint’s skylock system suggests using it in conjunction with verint’s imsi catcher, called the engage gi2. together, they allow government agencies “to accurately pinpoint their suspect for apprehension, making it virtually impossible for targets to escape, no matter where they reside in the world.”verint can install skylock on the networks of cellular carriers if they are cooperative — something that telecommunications experts say is common in countries where carriers have close relationships with their national governments. verint also has its own “worldwide ss7 hubs” that “are spread in various locations around the world,” says the brochure. it does not list prices for the services, though it says that verint charges more for the ability to track targets in many far-flung countries, as opposed to only a few nearby ones.among the most appealing features of the system, the brochure says, is its ability to sidestep the cellular operators that sometimes protect their users’ personal information by refusing government requests or insisting on formal court orders before releasing information.“in most cases mobile operators are not willing to cooperate with operational agencies in order to provide them the ability to gain control and manipulate the network services given to its subscribers,” the brochure says. “verint’s skylock is a global geo-location solution which was designed and developed to address the limitations mentioned above, and meet operational agency requirements.”another company, defentek, markets a similar system called infiltrator global real-time tracking system on its web site, claiming to “locate and track any phone number in the world.”the site adds: “it is a strategic solution that infiltrates and is undetected and unknown by the network, carrier, or the target.”the company, which according to the web site is registered in panama city, declined to comment for this story.follow the post’s tech blog, the switch, where technology and policy connect.craig timberg is a national technology reporter for the post.thanks for a great post zapharonicon. absolutely right. clearnet link: http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article31319.htmlbetter to train them to love their servitude through coercion than threat of billy clubs and jackboots.

(the government would later claim they only demanded the encryption keys because of my ""noncompliance"".) i didn’t realize until i retained an attorney that what the agents proposed would have exceeded their authority.bothered by what the agents were saying, i informed them i would first need to read the order they had just delivered and then consult with an attorney. the feds seemed surprised by my hesitation.what ensued was a flurry of legal proceedings that would last 38 days. when the dust settled i found myself the owner of a $10,000 civil contempt fine, my business shut down, and bit by bit, the very principle upon which i founded it – that we all have a right to personal privacy, slipping quickly away. (to appreciate just how fast the case moved, consider the median timeframe for a similar proceedings was 9.7 months in 2012.)the government lawyers tried to overwhelm me. in the first two weeks, i was served court orders a total of seven times – leading to contact with the fbi every other day. (this was the stretch a prosecutor would later characterize as the ""long period of silence"".) it took a week for me to identify an attorney who could adequately represent me given the complex issues involved – and we were in contact for less than a day when agents served me with a summons ordering me to appear in a virginia courtroom (over 1,000 miles from home). two days later, after admitting their demand to my lawyer, i was served a subpoena for the encryption keys – also marking the first time they put their demand in writing.with such short notice, my first attorney was unable to appear alongside me in court. because the whole case was under seal, i couldnt admit to anyone who wasnt a lawyer that i needed help, let alone why. in the days before my appearance i would spend hours repeating the facts of the case to a dozen attorneys, as i sought someone else that was qualified to represent me. i also discovered that as a third party in a federal criminal indictment, i had no right to counsel. thus my pleas for more time were denied. after all, only my property was in jeopardy – not my liberty. my right to a “fair hearing” was treated as a nuisance, easily trampled by a team of determined prosecutors. in the end, i was forced to choose between appearing alone, or face a bench warrant for my arrest.when i appeared in virginia, the government replaced their subpoena for the encryption key with a search warrant and a new court date. i retained a small local law firm before returning home, and they took on the task of assembling a legal strategy and filing briefs in the few short days available. the court barred them from consulting outside experts, making it difficult to understand the complex legal and technological issues involved. even a request to discuss the case with members of congress was denied. to make matters worse, the court wouldn’t deliver transcripts for my first appearance for another two months. my legal team was forced to proceed without access to information they needed.then, a federal judge entered an order of contempt against me – without even a hearing. let me be clear. i did not devoted 10 years of my life to building lavabit, with its focus on privacy, only to become complicit in a plan which would have meant the wholesale violation of my customers’ right to privacy. thus with my options in court exhausted, the decision was easy. i had to shut down my service. placing my faith in the integrity of the appeals process.when the judge granted the contempt charge unopposed – ignoring my attorney’s request to dispute the government’s claims – he created a loophole. i was never given an opportunity to object, let alone provide a meaningful defense. an important point, since the contempt charge endorsed new legal claims – reversing what the court had previously indicated. without an objection on the record, the appellate court would rule that my right to an appeal had been waived – since the charges hadn’t been disputed in district court. given the supreme court’s tradition of declining to review cases decided on procedural grounds, i will likely be denied justice, forever.the most important question raised by my appeal was what constitutes a ""search,"" i.e., whether law enforcement may demand the encryption keys of a business and use those keys to inspect the private communications of every customer, when they are only authorized to access information belonging to a select few.the problem here is technological: until a communication has been decrypted and the contents parsed, it is impossible for a surveillance device to determine which network connections belong to the targeted accounts. the government argued that since the ""inspection"" would be carried out by a machine, they were exempt from the normal search-and-seizure protections of the fourth amendment.more importantly, the prosecution argued the exemption was because my users had no expectation of privacy, even though the encryption they were trying to break was created specifically to ensure a users privacy.if my experience serves any purpose, it is to illustrate what most already know: our courts must not be allowed to consider matters of great importance in secret, lest we find ourselves summarily deprived of meaningful due process. if we allow our government to continue operating in secret, it is only a matter of time before you or a loved one find yourself in a position like i was – standing in a secret courtroom, alone, and without any of the unalienable rights that are supposed to protect us from an abuse of the state’s authority.sincerely,ladar levisonowner and operator, lavabit llcwith my fight in court all but lost, i am focusing my attention on a technical fix. help me put control over who

searching, i have decided to suspend operations. i wish that i could legally share with you the events that led to my decision. i cannot. i feel you deserve to know what’s going on--the first amendment is supposed to guarantee me the freedom to speak out in situations like this. unfortunately, congress has passed laws that say otherwise. as things currently stand, i cannot share my experiences over the last six weeks, even though i have twice made the appropriate requests.what’s going to happen now? we’ve already started preparing the paperwork needed to continue to fight for the constitution in the fourth circuit court of appeals. a favorable decision would allow me resurrect lavabit as an american company.this experience has taught me one very important lesson: without congressional action or a strong judicial precedent, i would _strongly_ recommend against anyone trusting their private data to a company with physical ties to the united states.sincerely,ladar

0,False,General Discussion ->Security,Medica,40,English,"what ive learned as an internet drug dealerwritten by kenny spotzjuly 16, 2014 // 09:00 am estquotemany fans of bitcoin would like to distance the technology from the reputation it has gained as the currency of choice for drug dealers and criminals on the internet. but to ignore the cryptocurrencys use in illicit markets is to miss a vital part of what has made it successful. food trucks and floundering satellite television companies accepting digital cash is nice, but if you want to see where the real action is in this new economy, you need to enter the deep web.so one afternoon, i downloaded the tor browser, checked out /r/darknetmarkets for site recommendations, found one i liked, and took the dive.of course, i had heard about these sites for a long time, but it was still shocking to see what was on offer on my computer screen: row after row of listings for heroin, meth, mdma, weed, coke, and any other drug you could want. it was amazon for drugs, all priced in bitcoin, all available for convenient vacuum sealed delivery to the mailing address of your choice.much like other e-commerce sites, every vendor on the site had a username and rating to help customers know which of these strangers selling potent narcotics over the internet had a track record of trustworthiness. one name in particular stood out, a vendor who had hundreds of completed sales with a nearly flawless feedback rating.i sent a simple message identifying myself as a journalist and asking if he or she would be interested in an interview. to my surprise, a quick response appeared in my inbox: he or she would be happy to chat. the only stipulations were that we use pgp encrypted messaging and that i did not include his or her actual username in my article. the dealer chose the handle ""rainduck"" for our interview.over the next week we exchanged messages about being a vendor on the dark web site evolution, integrity on the black market, what it’s like to run a business thats dependent on the bitcoin network, and the war on drugs—at a time when that war is shifting to the web.its not easy to estimate the amount of drugs sold online, but estimates by the united nations and others say the market is multiplying in size. to stop the internet trade, the un says that postal inspectors, customs agents, and ""other agencies"" are ""vital to ensure that points in the supply chain could be more effectively cut off and make it more difficult for buyers to obtain products.”a number of questions to rainduck went nowhere: when i asked for rainducks age, he apologized. ""im sorry but i cant give even an approximate answer to that question. im old enough that i can do this safely, but not old enough to die of natural causes. thats the best answer i can give, somewhere between 25 and 90.""motherboard: why did you become a vendor?rainduck: i became a vendor after quite a bit of experience starting as a buyer. when i discovered the darknet markets, i saw an opportunity to avoid the shadyness that comes with buying drugs from a friend of a friend of that one guy that i met at a bar. i could buy drugs from someone after reading dozens of reviews on their service and product, and feel confident that i was getting what i was paying for.unfortunately vendors online can rip people off just as drug dealers in person can. there is a degree of safety, but some vendors follow a pattern of providing legitimate service for a short period of time before ripping a bunch of people off and running away with the money.i saw an opportunity to provide a legitimate service to my customers. i became a vendor and made it a point to prove that i am honest and trustworthy. i made a name for myself and became known as the type of person who you could trust. ive had many opportunities to rip people off without repercussions, but ive never once scammed someone. reputation is everything on the darknet markets, and establishing myself as a trustworthy individual has been far more profitable for me than being a con artist. to summarize, i saw an opportunity to provide a degree of service that is uncommon in the world of drugs, and decided to fill that void.were you involved in this industry before your current account? and if so, how long have you been in the business?i have indeed been involved prior to my current account. unfortunately i cant go into specifics. staying anonymous is the most important factor to any vendor who values his/her freedom, and being in the spotlight is not always a good thing. when someone has too much attention drawn to them its sometimes best to step back and lay low for awhile, and that applies to the internet just as much as to drug dealers in real life.you are currently using a centralized marketplace. what are your thoughts on decentralized marketplaces (i.e. the dark market project) and what they mean for the future of online commerce?good question. to those who dont know, centralized marketplaces hold all of the money for you. tens of thousands of buyers and vendors will trust the marketplace to hold their money in escrow, and they release the funds from the buyer to the seller when both users confirm that the transaction has been complete.the downside to this model is that the amount of money the marketplaces hold at a time can reach hundreds of millions of dollars, and its held by someone who has the opportunity to run away with the money at any time. in the last year there have been several marketplaces that have run away with a total of well over a billion dollars. many peoples lives have been ruined by money loss, and the community as a whole is very distrustful of this business model after several recent scams.decentralized marketplaces limit their own power, and rather than keeping the money in their own account, they essentially hold ""keys"" to the accounts that the money is held in. two people must use their keys in order to unlock the funds from escrow, whether those two people are the buyer and vendor, or the buyer and the marketplace, or the vendor and the marketplace. this allows the marketplace the ability to resolve issues without giving them the freedom to run off with large sums of money.the downside to this model is that from a technical side it can be very hard to use. so far most of the decentralized marketplaces require some degree of programming knowledge, or external software, or otherwise are too complicated for the average user. for that reason most of the decentralized marketplaces attract less traffic. in the long run, i believe that we will move almost entirely to using decentralized markets, but it may be another year or two before the sites are streamlined to allow both the buyers and the vendors to use this kind of marketplace easily.what is your average revenue and profit in a month?unfortunately thats not a question i feel comfortable answering. i can say that there is a very large amount of money that can be made in this industry,and i make more than enough.    being a vendor online is just like owning or managing a business—the only difference being that the government decided that what we do is illegal.did you have prior business experience before coming to this industry?i did. most people dont consider selling drugs to be a business, but the successful vendors treat it just like any other business. its important to have good time management skills, accounting skills, as well as customer service skills. being a vendor online is just like owning or managing a business—the only difference being that the government decided that what we do is illegal.what do you think is the biggest misconception about dark net markets?i think there are two equally large but opposing misconceptions. some people believe that using darknet markets as a buyer is extremely dangerous and they dont feel comfortable doing so because they think if a few grams of weed is sent to them that they will undoubtedly go to jail. others are too confident in the safety of the markets, and they will openly talk about sensitive information that could easily lead to their arrest.the reality is somewhere in the middle. for security reasons most marketplaces require buyers to encrypt their addresses using special software that only allows a specific person to read it. however there are a shocking number of people who dont encrypt sensitive info and openly admit online to crimes that could easily lead to their arrest if the information were in the wrong hands.at the same time, law enforcement for the most part is after the large-scale buyers and vendors who are moving large amounts of product. although if given the opportunity they may try to arrest someone buying a small amount of weed, the truth is that the level of caution needed for someone interested in buying a quarter ounce of weed is completely different than the amount of paranoia and protection needed for someone buying thousands of dollars of product on a regular basis.use common sense and protect yourself, but realize that there are a plethora of people who use these sites on a regular basis, and 99.99% of the people who do so will never encounter any problems doing so. the system is designed to be relatively safe for the buyers, and in most cases youre more likely to go to jail for buying drugs in real life than online.    i just want to make sure that they know whats in it, rather than buying cocaine from some random guy that turns out to be laundry detergent. do you have any qualms about the fact that you may be supporting the problems of drug addicts?initially yes, though after becoming more involved in this community i look at things differently. even among the ""hard drugs"" such as meth and heroin, many of the people who do it are not bad people, and not all of them are addicted. most people only see the stereotypes. the truth is that while there are people who have used drugs and became addicted to them and had their lives ruined, a surprising number of the people who use drugs regularly you would never know. i regularly get messages from people who confide in me that although they are a successful businessperson, theres not a single person who knows about their drug use because its not socially acceptable.prohibition has never worked. it didnt work with alcohol and it doesnt work with drugs. people should make their own choices. im not here to judge people for what they do, i just want to make sure that if they make that choice, they get it safely, at a fair price, and that they know whats in it rather than buying cocaine from some random guy that turns out to be laundry detergent. theres no doubt that drugs can be dangerous, but sometimes the lengths that people are forced to go through to get their drugs are more dangerous than the drugs themselves.do you use your own products?i do occasionally, though i dont use all of the drugs that i sell. i dont mix business with pleasure, and i dont have the time to do so often even if i wanted to. my use of my products is mainly limited to testing them and making sure they are safe before sending them off to my customers.drug legalization is slowly gaining traction among policy experts. do you think, twenty years from now, this industry wont be relegated to the lesser traveled corners of the internet?yes and no. there is increasing pressure to legalize drugs, but unfortunately most of that focus is strictly on marijuana, and thats at the state level more than the federal level. its impossible to say what will happen 20 years from now, but there are too many people who profit off of the fact that drugs are illegal. prisons, police officers, tobacco companies, and alcohol companies all would lose an unbelievable amount of funding if drugs were legalized.its sad to think that the majority of people in jail right now are there for possession or sale of small amounts of drugs, but unfortunately its a cat and mouse game that take an insane amount of money from taxpayers and puts it in the pockets of the corporations that stand to benefit from the way the laws are structured now.only time will tell what will happen, but i doubt that 5, or 10, or even 20 years from now people will be openly doing cocaine, meth, shrooms, heroin, or acid, though i do think that weed has a much larger chance of being completely legalized due to the fact that its more socially acceptable.you say that there are ""too many people who profit off of the fact that drugs are illegal"" for anyone to expect widespread legalization anytime soon. do you think thats the central motivation for the ""war on drugs""? or is it more about protecting the public?i think that point of view is very accurate. a lot of people seem to look at it as a conspiracy, but i dont necessarily think thats the case. rather, its the people who profit off prohibition who spend very large sums of money to lobby politicians in washington. it would be naive to think thats not the case. polls shows that the public is largely in favor of legalization (of certain drugs at least) and yet no one at the political level seems to be in any rush to make things happen.at the very least, drug use should be legalized. if they want to keep throwing us dealers in jail thats one thing, but the fact that 98% of drug related arrests involve simple possession is ridiculous, and its not okay that millions of peoples lives are being ruined when most of them simply were caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, and for doing something that would be completely okay if they lived in certain states (such as california and colorado).this answer refers mainly to marijuana of course, but again the point remains. there are almost as many people who smoke marijuana as there are who drink alcohol, and weed kills significantly less people. if we are still putting people in jail for possession of a much safer substance than alcohol, i wouldnt count on heroin being legalized anytime soon.you have to worry about law enforcement in your business. have there been any close calls?i can say that if i had what i would consider to be a close call i would get out of the business completely, but that doesnt mean i feel completely safe either. in this business its always better to be too paranoid than not paranoid enough.    knowing that im helping to safely provide medication for someone who otherwise wouldnt have the ability to get it is more rewarding than anything else. that said, the money isnt bad either.how do you deal with, what i would imagine to be, the constant stress from this paranoia?unfortunately i havent figured that part out yet. my business keeps me busy most of the time, and unlike traditional jobs i dont get vacation days or time off. im too busy to focus on the constant stress i endure, and although that may sound pessimistic to some degree, im overall very happy with my life. i love what i do and knowing im providing a service that not many people can offer.mainly its the people who purchase drugs not recreationally but for medicinal purposes that makes it all worth it. i regularly have people confide in me that my products are the only thing that has relieved their pain, and many of my customers are old enough that they dont have the ability to buy from a friend of a friend. knowing that im helping to safely provide medication for someone who otherwise wouldnt have the ability to get it is more rewarding than anything else. that said, the money isnt bad either.would you consider vending online to be a safer option than vending in person?for the vendors, dealing in person would be safer. for the buyers, the reverse is true. law enforcement mainly targets the vendors, and most buyers have nothing to worry about unless they are ordering very large amounts of product. there have been reports of buyers being questioned after failing to take the proper steps to protect themselves, but buying online is generally much safer than buying in person for most circumstances.    for a vendor, all it takes is one message that is accidently left unencrypted, one fingerprint left on the inside of a package, or one strand of hair.if dealing in person is safer, then why do you choose to vend online?overall dealing in person is safer, but it depends what you are selling, who you are selling to, and how much. if you know what youre doing, vending online has the potential to be safer than dealing in person, but the risk lies not in what you are doing, but the mistakes you make. for a vendor, all it takes is one message that is accidently left unencrypted, one fingerprint left on the inside of a package, or one strand of hair that could potentially lead to their arrest if in the wrong hands.a vendor that knows what they are doing can be perfectly safe, but unfortunately theres no college course for being an internet drug dealer. the only way to learn is to try it, but unfortunately this is one industry where making mistakes while learning is not okay. essentially i choose to vend online because i feel i have the knowledge and ability to do so safely. for the majority of people who take the same path however, they are playing russian roulette and they will either make very little money, quit shortly after, or law enforcement will just wait for them to make a mistake.do you run a solo operation or are there employees?sorry but i cant answer that.    when business is good bitcoin volatility isnt an issue, but when business is slow, a drop in the value of bitcoin can be the difference between making a profit and breaking even or even losing money.how does bitcoins volatility affect your business?when business is good bitcoin volatility isnt an issue, but when business is slow, a drop in the value of bitcoin can be the difference between making a profit and breaking even or even losing money.bitcoin can definitely play a huge role in the amount of income vendors make, especially for newer vendors. vendors that have not earned trust in the community are almost always required by the marketplaces to use their escrow system. on average it can take about a week between the time the package is sent and the time the money is released from escrow, but in some cases if there are problems with an order it can take 3 weeks or more.in addition, the vendors have to find a way to safely and anonymously convert bitcoin into actual currency, which can take even longer. considering that bitcoin can stay around the same rate for weeks and then suddenly increase or decrease by hundreds of dollars in a matter of days, newer vendors may find themselves gambling with their profits.many vendors who are more established can get away with requiring the funds to be released from escrow before sending packages. even then it can be several days from the point the order is placed to where the vendor has the money physically in their possession, but it tends to average out over time. if a vendor does a lot of business consistently over time, they can accept short term losses from drops in bitcoin, knowing that at some point they will make more money if bitcoin goes up in the future.how do you cash out your bitcoins?again, answering that question would be a security violation. i take very great lengths to make sure that i cash out my bitcoins safely, but elaborating on exactly what i do is not something im willing to share.    there are plenty of people who purchase from the darknet markets and resell the product wholesale, taking advantage of the cheap prices of chinese-made drugs specifically.among people in the ""real world"" of drug dealing, is bitcoin gaining a name for itself?not at all. the majority of ""real world"" drug dealers have no idea what bitcoin is or even that this community exists. of those who do, they certainly wont share that information with others. there is a huge opportunity for drug dealers to make a very large amount of money reselling the right products, but no one wants anyone else to know that. there are plenty of people who purchase from the darknet markets and resell the product wholesale, taking advantage of the cheap prices of chinese-made drugs specifically, but its a very small percentage of dealers who do so.darkmarket sellers were some of the first in the world to rely heavily on the bitcoin network for their trade. considering this wealth of experience, do you think bitcoin has a legitimate chance at becoming a widely used method of payment for transactions beyond the black market? or do you think of it as mainly useful for what you do today and nothing else?i think bitcoin has the potential to become a widely used method of payment in general. unfortunately until recently its been very unstable, and few legitimate businesses want to take the chance of accepting a payment method that may be worth 20 percent less a few days from now. most businesses that accept bitcoin are owned by people who believe in the long-term potential of bitcoin, but currently the number of businesses who do so are few and far between. that said, there are a small number of very large businesses who have recently stated their intentions to accept bitcoin, and i believe that will encourage other smaller businesses to do the same.right now the bitcoin community is divided mainly among those who use it as an investment and those who use it for illicit purposes. fortunately it seems that recently there are efforts by bitcoin investors to use it for more legitimate purposes, and we are seeing an exponential number of businesses offering services such as hotel rooms and flight, as well as retailers offering electronics, furniture, and other commodities. its too early to tell exactly how this will play out, but there are enough people who believe strongly in the long term future of bitcoin that i truly believe we will see much more widespread use of it for legitimate purposes. bitcoin certainly isnt going away anytime soon.do you plan on being in this business for a long time?i do. ive done quite a bit in my life, but nothing has been as satisfying as being a vendor. its stressful, dangerous, and time consuming, but the rewards are great.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1063038,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,self

""length"" arguments for example get passed one of a whole bunch of potentially interesting values.trinity also shares those file descriptors between multiple processes, which causes havoc sometimes.if a child process successfully creates an mmap, the pointer is stored, and fed to subsequent syscalls, sometimes with hilarious results.trinity supports alpha, aarch64, arm, i386, ia-64, mips, powerpc-32, powerpc-64, s390, s390x, sparc-64, x86-64.adding support for additional architectures is a small amount of work mostly involving just defining the order of the syscall table.see documentation/hacking for details.quote    there are almost always new kernel bugs being triggered by trinity. i used to maintain a list of the bugs found/fixed, but it got to be too much work to keep track of.    sometimes, trinity causes the oom-killer to trigger. as long as the oom-killer picks the right process (ie, one of the trinity children, and not dbus, or networkmanager etc) then this is working as designed.    theres a fair amount of ""noise"" printks in the kernel that trinity triggers. i keep a set of patches to remove the most common ones in git. it should always apply to linus latest tree. for older kernels, you may have to fix up some parts.    if you do find and report a new kernel bug, please cc me, and mention that you found it with trinity. one of my irc contacts fuzzes his own system and manually patches vulnerabilities as he finds them. he legit scares me with how leet he is tbh.

0,False,General Discussion ->Security,,40,English,"kmf2 is completely right. fuzzing is an extremely useful tool for finding exploitable bugs. while fuzzing alone is not sufficient to just pump out 0day after 0day, with enough computing power and time, you can find a large amount of exploitable bugs in popular programs which were never found before. of course you need to be experienced with exploit development to turn a simple crash into something which reliably executes your shellcode, but it is completely true that a fuzzer can be used to mine for ore used to make 0days.fuzzing is not random ""brute forcing"", btw. it is far more complex than that. would brute forcing be able to synthesize large, entirely valid jpeg files from thin air, like so? https://lcamtuf.blogspot.is/2014/11/pulling-jpegs-out-of-thin-air.htmlbtw, regarding trinity, theres something else you might like even better. trinity itself just spits out random (well, sensical but random) shit at syscalls, but it doesnt have any idea what is going on in the kernel. there is another project, called syzkaller, which is an instrumented syscall fuzzer. its like afl (american fuzzy lop, the instrumented binary fuzzer) combined with trinity. while i havent tested it out myself, it seems like it will yield some pretty damn impressive results, especially against those horrific syscalls with non-negligible attack surface areas but which are too racy or locky to fuzz effectively with trinity, like futex()! speaking of which, if you dont mind kernel patching, you should really patch out all the _pi futex operations. just saying.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1063080,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,hacking tools,151701,You can essentially mine for zero days,105429

is, there is a better way to do this using just electrum.anyone care to explain?im not sure exactly what it is youre asking but heres a couple of tutorials about using multi-sig escrow (im not sure where either of them came from im afraid). props must go to the author of each one, whoever that may be.  regardless of which market youre using, the principal behind multi-sig escrow is always the same. each market may have their own ways of doing things but at the end of the day, they all follow the same principals to achieve the desired result. quotethis is the best real multisig available, offering the most features and ease of use. no money is ever held on the market.multisignature (multisig) escrowmultisignature escrow is an type of escrow that takes advantages of new features being added to bitcoin. opting to use multisignature escrow provides a more secure and less centralized method to escrow funds.funds held in multisignature addresses are not directly held by the market but rather are held on the blockchain and are secured by the keys of the participants. in the event the server is compromised the multisignature escrow funds are not affected, and by utilizing the timelock feature explained below escrow can be easily completed without the market.vocabularymultisignature address - an address that is created from 2 or more bitcoin public keys and requires a number of those keys to transfer the funds. our escrow system uses a 2-of-3 multisignature escrow, which means it requries two of the three participants to release the funds held on the multisignature address.redeem script - a redeem script is a cryptographic hash that provides information about a multisignature address, specifically which regular bitcoin addresses are included in a given multisignature address.timelock transaction - a timelock transaction is a transaction created and signed by the market but with the timelock variable set to some time in the future. it can be signed and broadcasted by any participant of the multisignature escrow transaction but the signed transaction is not valid until the timelock date. merchants receive a timelock transaction 31 days from the order creation and customers receive a timelock transaction 45 days from the creation of the order. these can be used to release funds from the multisignature escrow if the market is not accessible.bitcoin public key - each bitcoin address has an associated keypair, or public key and private key. the private key is used send money and the public key is used generate bitcoin addresses to receive money.introductionin a basic multisignature escrow, a keypair is generated by the market and used along with the bitcoin public key of both the merchant and the customer to create a multisignature address.after placing an order, this multisignature address is automatically generated and given to the customer along with a redeem script and a timelock transaction. a redeem script is a cryptographic hash that can be used to verify the multisignature address, it will list all bitcoin addresses included in the multisignature address. a customer can verify that their address has been included, and if the merchant signed a pgp message of their address, the customer can also verify the merchant has been included.after verifying the multisignature address with the redeem script the customer now directly deposits into the multisignature address. once the first confirmation is received the order is marked as paid.next the merchant decides if they would like to accept the order, they are given the redeem script so they can verify their address was included before shipping the product. optionally if the customer created a pgp signed message with their address they can verify the customer was included in the creation of the multisignature address. once they verify they can mark accept and ship their product.if the process is cancelled the customer is given a transaction signed by the market, all they are required to do is sign the transaction and broadcast it to receive their refund. in this case, the 2-of-3 of the required keys to complete the transfer are the customer and the market.once the product is marked as received, the customer needs to do nothing else. the merchant will receive a signed transaction by the market and all they are required to do is sign the transaction and broadcast it to receive their payment. in this case, the 2-of-3 of the required signatures to make the transfer are the merchant and the market.in the event of a dispute where there is a partial refund a signed transaction is generated and given to both parties. it only takes either the customer or the merchant to sign the transaction to release the funds.how to get startedboth customers and merchants are required to supply a bitcoin public key to get started, optionally they can also provide a signed message containing a bitcoin address associated with the bitcoin public key.electrum 1. right click a bitcoin address in ""addresses"" and select ""public key"" 2. save the public key in the appropriate place in your profile.bitcoin-qt 1. copy one of your bitcoin addresses 2. go to the help menu, select debug console. type ""validateaddress "" and paste in the address, the end result being ""validateaddress <address>"". hit enter and it will reveal the bitcoin public key for that address. 3. save the public key in the appropriate place in your profile.(optional) for added security you can also use your pgp key to sign the bitcoin address associated with the public key you save in your settings. doing this allows the other party to verify that your public key was used in the generation of the multisignature address when they check the redeem script.after saving the public key to your account you have everything you need set up to start using multisignature escrow.customerafter setting up your public key, select a product offering multisig. initiate your purchase and on the payment page you will find the redeem script and the multisignature address for the transaction. after checking the validity of the redeem script, deposit directly to the multisignature address.when the product arrives, mark the order as received. if everything goes well that is all you are required to do to make a purchase.if the order is rejected by the merchant, you will receive a transaction signed by the market. sign this transaction using either electrum, bitcoin-qt or an offline/self-hosted version of coinbin and broadcast it to the bitcoin network. in the case of a dispute where the merchant grants a full refund, this is also how you would receive your refund.in the case of a dispute with a partial refund, you and the merchant will receive a transaction signed by the market. either you or the merchant can sign and broadcast the transaction for it to be valid.merchantafter setting up your public key, you can add the option for multisignature escrow to a listing. once you receive an order, check the validity of the redeem script and accept the order.when the order is marked as received by the customer you will receive a transaction signed by the market. sign this transaction using either electrum, bitcoin-qt or an offline/self-hosted version of coinbin and broadcast it to the bitcoin network.if a dispute arises, if you agree to a full refund there is nothing you are required to do. if there is a partial refund or no refund you will receive a transaction signed by the market. sign this transaction using either electrum, bitcoin-qt or an offline/self-hosted version of coinbin and broadcast it to the bitcoin network.and here is another tutorial about multi-sig with electrum (again im not sure about who wrote it). thanks to the author whoever it may be.quote greetings yall! its time to learn how to multisig!!!!recently, electrum 2.0 came out, along with the ability to create 2 of 3 multisig wallets. we will be walking through how to complete this process, both from the buyers end and vendors end, both covering the mechanics and whats happening. the market admins can figure it out for themselves what to do. we will cover what goes down in the events of a normal transaction, and in the events of a dispute.if you dont get this guide the first time through, give it time. come back in a day later, look it over again. its a fairly complex process, give it time to sink in.buyers end first. you are in charge of making the wallet, and providing funds to it.    get electrum 2.0

multisig addresses. http://i.imgur.com/xsi87t6.png    you are responsible for funding the correct amount of bitcoins to an address on this wallet. remember, any funds transfered there cant be transfered back without without 2 of 3 consensus. be careful to send the correct amount. after this is done, your work is done until its time to finalize the transaction (which you will do in a timely manner, as you are not a little bitch).vendors its your turn!generate your master public key    get electrum 2.0 www.electrum.org/#download    run electrum.    select create new wallet and

each, order doesnt matter. next.    verify the correct funds are present.    you are responsible for creating two transactions. one is to pay the market their previously agreed upon share. the other is to pay yourself the rest to the correct bitcoin address. you wont be able to complete these, but you will generate the text needed for the customer or market to sign off on these transactions. these will be exported as .txn text files, which you can then copy and share the contents to the market message system, for the buyer or market to fully sign the transaction.    click the send tab    enter correct address, and amount, then click send. http://i.imgur.com/tf6q5uu.png    agree to the fee. http://i.imgur.com/sypij6f.png    provide your password. http://i.imgur.com/thommbj.png    save

http://i.imgur.com/tcisntx.png    copy paste each transaction (one at a time), starting with paying the market first. http://i.imgur.com/ev3g9ml.png    it should load up a small window, giving signing

copy of that key, and can saunter into your living room to poke around your belongings while you’re out, and without your knowledge.by way of metaphor, this is exactly how the royal canadian mounted police, canada’s federal police force, intercepted and decrypted “over one million” blackberry messages during an investigation into a mafia slaying, called “project clemenza,"" that ran between 2010 and 2012.using these messages and other evidence, the crown mounted a case known as r. v. mirarchi against seven men connected to the killing of sal “the ironworker” montagna, a reputed member of the new york bonanno crime family, on the outskirts of montreal. on march 30, six of the men pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, and the seventh to being an accessory after the fact.according to privacy expert christopher parsons from canadian security research hub citizen lab, the rcmp may still have the ability to read anybody’s encrypted blackberry messages, as long as the phone isn’t linked to a corporate account.“so right now, with my device, if i’m not on the [business enterprise server], i’m a dead chicken. that’s the reality of it, that’s what we don’t want the general public to know”while apple recently fought the us department of justice in court over an order to create new software to help unlock a terror suspect’s phone—and has pledged to continue to do so—canada’s police and device manufacturers have been comparatively silent on the issue. now, for the first time, canadians have a clearer picture of how digital surveillance in this country works, at least when it comes to blackberry phones, although much is still unknown.the revelations could also spell bad news for blackberry, which has struggled financially in recent years and built its brand on the supposed security of its messaging system. during the case, witnesses from the rcmp and blackberry testified that revealing blackberry’s encryption key would be, in short, bad for business.this story is part of a joint investigation with vice news. check them out for more details about how canadian police obtained the master key to millions of cellphones.***blackberry (formerly rim) encrypts all messages sent between consumer phones, known as pin-to-pin or bbm messages, using a single “global encryption key” that’s loaded onto every handset during manufacturing. with this one key, any and all messages sent between consumer blackberry phones can be decrypted and read. in contrast, business enterprise servers allow corporations to use their own encryption key, which not even blackberry can access.according to more than 3,000 pages of court documents pertaining to the case that resulted from project clemenza, obtained by vice canada, the rcmp maintains a server in ottawa that “simulates a mobile device that receives a message intended for [the rightful recipient].” in an affidavit, rcmp sergeant patrick boismenu states that the server “performs the decryption of the message using the appropriate decryption key.” the rcmp calls this the “blackberry interception and processing system.”the defence in the case surmised that the rcmp must have used the “correct global encryption key,” since any attempt to apply a key other than blackberry’s own global encryption key would have resulted in a garbled mess. according to the judge, “all parties”—including the crown—agree that “the rcmp would have had the correct global key when it decrypted messages during its investigation.”“by resorting to the global key,” the judge’s decision on the crown’s objection to disclosing the key states, “the rcmp was able to decrypt the intercepted messages.” it isn’t clear how the rcmp obtained the key, and the judge’s statement addressing the matter is heavily redacted due to a sealing order.“it is not a good marketing thing to say we work with the police""the defence initially argued that the rcmp should disclose the global encryption key in court, but it was ultimately considered privileged and withheld. if the key used in project clemenza was revealed in open court, boismenu said, then it would “essentially mean to disclose a key that would unlock the doors of all the houses of the people who use the provider’s services, and that, without their knowledge.”the key, according to boismenu, is so powerful that it could be used to “illegitimately” decipher any “prerecorded communications encrypted with that key”—so it’s striking that the rcmp had access to it.indeed, crown attorney robert rouleau stated in an ex parte hearing: “so right now, with my device, if i’m not on the [business enterprise server], i’m a dead chicken. that’s the reality of it, that’s what we don’t want the general public to know.”disclosing such a key would be disastrous for blackberry, the court heard. blackberry director of national security alan treddenick said in an affidavit from november of 2015 that disclosing the key used in project clemenza would “potentially impact relationships with other blackberry end-users and law enforcement criminal investigations globally for all foreign countries that blackberry operates and provides communication services,” and in canada.rcmp inspector mark flynn testified in a heavily redacted transcript that blackberry “facilitated the interception process,” however, flynn also stated that facilitation could mean mere information sharing or a physical action to aid interception.flynn further testified that revealing the key would jeopardize the rcmp’s working relationship with blackberry, and harm blackberry itself, since “it is not a good marketing thing to say we work with the police.”if blackberry has not changed the global encryption key since project clemenza, parsons of citizen lab said, then “the rcmp would still possess the capability to decrypt all pin-to-pin communications that do not use unique encryption keys, which are only available for devices associated with blackberry enterprise servers.”it’s unlikely that blackberry has changed the key, parsons said, partly because changing the global key would mean rolling out a “massive update that likely was on the per-handset level.”a diagram showing the rcmps blackberry decryption pipeline from patrick boismenus affidavit. from the carrier, the messages are intercepted and sent to the rcmp, where they are filtered according to current interception orders. the rcmp server then completes a series of technical steps, including decryption using the global encryption key, that mimic the workings of a real blackberry phone.the rcmp also used a spy tool popular with us police known as an imsi catcher, or “stingray,” which collects phone numbers and other identifying information from devices within a one kilometre radius, according to court documents.according to the defence, “thousands” of innocents were likely surveilled with imsi catchers during project clemenza alone. an affidavit from jocelyn fortin, an rcmp officer for 12 years, reveals that she had imsi catcher training dating back to 2005.the office of the privacy commissioner of canada, the country’s top privacy watchdog, recently opened an investigation into the rcmp’s secretive use of the controversial surveillance technology.it’s not entirely clear how the rcmp obtained blackberry’s global encryption key, based on the court records obtained. however, redacted court documents state that the rcmp sent so-called “comfort letters” to blackberry asking for assistance in intercepting messages and in “taking the appropriate steps and proceeding with configurations to ensure successful interceptions of certain devices.”the defence also states that the rcmp communicated with blackberry whenever the police began monitoring a new blackberry pin “to request their assistance,” and when they stopped.if the key didn’t come directly from blackberry, parsons said, then the rcmp could have independently swiped it from a device, or hired a third party contractor to do all the work for them.watch more from motherboard: the lost art of canadas doomed pre-internet web“in the latter two cases, even if blackberry did change the global encryption key, its plausible that the rcmp would be able to just get the new key and use it, assuming that blackberry even changed the key in the first place,” parsons explained.the rcmp declined to comment on the case at hand, saying instead, “using encryption to secure data and communications assists in crime prevention but may also inhibit the lawfully authorized interception of communications and evidence gathering in national security and criminal investigations.”while the courts may “compel” a third party—like blackberry—to help during an investigation, the rcmp statement reads, “there is no specific power in the criminal code to compel a third party to decrypt or develop decryption tools, nor is there any requirement for telecommunications services to provide these services.”defence lawyer michael lacy, however, said that this statement is “an overstatement of the law,” and that even though there is no explicit power relating to encryption backdoors in the criminal code, there may still be legal means to order a company to assist the police with decryption.blackberry declined to comment on this story.a spokesperson for rogers, the only service provider explicitly named by the court as potentially co-operating with the rcmp, wrote in an email: “we safeguard customers’ information and fully comply with canadian privacy law. at the same time we are required by law to respond to federal, provincial and municipal government and law enforcement agencies when they have a legally valid request—like a search warrant or court order.”“people are willing to say things or do things online when they believe that they enjoy security”while apple fought the us department of justice in court over a request to create new software to help unlock an iphone used by a terror suspect, blackberry has been very explicit about its intent to work with, and not against, law enforcement when it comes to encryption.blackberry ceo john chen stated in a 2015 blog post: ""we reject the notion that tech companies should refuse reasonable, lawful access requests. just as individual citizens bear responsibility to help thwart crime when they can safely do so, so do corporations have a responsibility to do what they can, within legal and ethical boundaries, to help law enforcement in its mission to protect us.""while the rcmp used their spy tech to investigate a grisly gangland murder in this case, parsons noted that this kind of surveillance can have a cooling effect on how innocent people act online.“people are willing to say things or do things online when they believe that they enjoy security,” said parsons. “in this case they caught a bunch of mobsters, but there’s a lot of people that may engage in risky or politically sensitive communications because they believe that their blackberry communications are secure.”some observers might have already assumed that the rcmp had the ability to intercept and decrypt blackberry messages (for example, the rcmp has cracked into blackberries retrofitted with pgp encryption), but never knew for sure—or how they really did it—until now.a flowchart published in boismenu’s affidavit shows that encrypted blackberry messages are first filtered by a carrier according to active interception orders and sent to rcmp, all before they reach the intended recipient.the rcmp may then further filter the messages they receive, and execute a series of technical actions on a server—including decryption—which are really “the same steps that would be made by the device of the rightful recipient of the information,” according to boismenu. finally, the decrypted messages are stored on the rcmp’s server in ottawa.a few unknowns remain in this case. for example: did blackberry itself provide the rcmp with the global encryption key, and has that key changed?there is little doubt, however, that during project clemenza, the rcmp had the key to every consumer blackberry user’s digital front door. and now, we don’t know if the locks have been changed.topics: rcmp, blackberry, privacy, rim, police, royal canadian mounted police, canada, exclusive, iphone, apple, encryption, rogerscontact motherboard

blackberry’s global decryption keyby justin ling and jordan pearsonapril 14, 2016 | 1:00 pmhttps://news.vice.com/article/exclusive-canada-police-obtained-blackberrys-global-decryption-key-howa high-level surveillance probe of montreals criminal underworld shows that canadas federal policing agency has had a global encryption key for blackberry devices since 2010.the revelations are contained in a stack of court documents that were made public after members of a montreal crime syndicate pleaded guilty to their role in a 2011 gangland murder. the documents shed light on the extent to which the smartphone manufacturer, as well as telecommunications giant rogers, cooperated with investigators.according to technical reports by the royal canadian mounted police that were filed in court, law enforcement intercepted and decrypted roughly one million pin-to-pin blackberry messages in connection with the probe. the report doesnt disclose exactly where the key — effectively a piece of code that could break the encryption on virtually any blackberry message sent from one device to another — came from. but, as one police officer put it, it was a key that could unlock millions of doors.government lawyers spent almost two years fighting in a montreal courtroom to keep this information out of the public record.and while neither the rcmp nor blackberry confirmed that the cellphone manufacturer handed over the global encryption key, and both fought against a judges order to release more information about their working relationship, the crown prosecutors admitted that the federal police service had access to the key.and if the global key is still sitting on a server in the rcmps headquarters, the potential consequences could be significant. although it wouldnt offer police a backdoor into most of its government and business clients, who make up blackberrys core constituency, it would mean that police enjoyed years of access to canadians personal cellphones without the public being any the wiser.in a technical report attempting to underscore the significance of this technology and filed with the superior court of quebec, the rcmp stated that ithad obtained ""the key that would unlock the doors of all the houses of the people who use the providers services, and that, without their knowledge.""in light of a very public spat between the american fbi and iphone manufacturer apple about encryption, and whether or not consumer technology companies should comply with government orders to create new software to help release the keys to the proverbial castle, the montreal case raises serious questions about the surveillance steps taken by police.""we dont actually understand how the rcmp is using the laws that are developed for them,"" said christopher parsons, a security researcher and postdoctoral fellow at the citizen lab. ""an awful lot of canadians would be surprised to learn that the rcmp would have this kind of capability.""this story is part of a joint investigation with motherboard. check them out for more details about how canadian police obtained the master key to millions of cellphones.***on november 24, 2011, the body of salvatore montagna washed up on the snow-covered shore of an island in the frigid assomption river, northeast of montreal.earlier that morning, local residents called 911. a man had jumped into the freezing water in a hail of gunfire, they told police. that man, montagna, ended up catching at least one bullet on the way.sal the iron worker, the dead mans moniker, was vying to fill a power vacuum in the montreal crime syndicate, according to police sources who spoke to postmedia at the time. reported talks to broker power in the family ended after a failed assassination attempt on one of montagnas main rivals, raynald desjardins.montagnas body, still warm and bleeding, washed up not far from the home where he had been before the shooting, which belonged to a jack simpson.but before they could even track down simpson, who had a record for cocaine trafficking, quebec investigators got a call from the royal canadian mounted police. they had been surveilling a cabal of suspected mobsters for more than a year.operation clemenza, as the rcmp probe was dubbed, happened to be following four individuals involved in the hit.six men, including simpson, were charged with first-degree murder. a seventh was charged with being an accessory after the fact.photo via the canadian press/graham hughesdesjardins pleaded guilty to a lower charge of conspiracy, but the rest of the accused went to court to fight. they wanted to know exactly how it was that the rcmp accessed the communications they had sent each other in the days leading up to the murder.operation clemenza didnt bug the suspects phones or install microphones in the smoke detectors. instead, the police had been surveilling aaaaaaacounts, shadow, gâteau, and jj — four pseudonyms assigned to blackberry messenger accounts. police linked up the screen names to real mobsters: aaaaaaacounts was pietro magistrale, shadow was felice racaniello, gâteau was steven fracas, and jj was simpson.to intercept the messages, the cops went to the service providers — either the suspects cellphone company, rogers; or blackberry itself.its not clear if the rcmp went to one, the other, or both, but what was revealed in the case is that the rcmp obtained assistance orders and sent ""comfort letters"" to blackberry — known during the court case as research in motion (rim) — asking for their cooperation in the case, and that the companys technicians consulted with the rcmps technical unit on these efforts to decrypt the phones.assistance orders are legal authority, issued by the court, that can compel service providers — like rogers, blackberry, and their ilk — to ""assist"" the police in carrying out other court orders, like wiretaps or search warrants. comfort letters are harder to pin down. more than one lawyer consulted by vice news were completely unfamiliar with the concept. but, according to defense lawyers who worked on the trial, they are essentially assurances provided by police to private individuals or corporations that the actions being requested of the individual or corporation are covered by an existing court order.""as part of a judicial authorization to intercept, the service provider will allow access to the information that transits on their network,"" reads a technical report filed by the rcmp with the court. the report details that the data is sent directly to a secure room at rcmp headquarters.obtaining the messages is only half of the equation. the data sitting there, on rcmp servers, would still be encrypted, a meaningless string of letters, numbers, and symbols. the only way to make that data legible would be to open it on a blackberry with the pin address of its intended recipient or use blackberrys global encryption code — the digital key that could break the lock on millions of private communications.for consumer-grade phones, the decryption key is in the companys possession. blackberry, however, also offers the option to run their blackberry enterprise server (bes) which allows clients to run their own network of phones, and keep possession of their own decryption key. the rcmps technique likely would not work on those phones.the report acknowledges in black-and-white that, as part of the process, ""the rcmp server performs the decryption of the message using the appropriate decryption key.""judge michael stober, in a series of hearings in november 2015, was enraptured with a question: where did the key come from?the question proved crucial for the defense counsel, who fought to be able to verify that the supposed decryption of their clients messages were authentic, and done legally.the crown prosecutor consistently refused to answer, telling the judge in a public hearing: ""im going to refrain from any comment because were walking a very very fine thread. i dont want to fall into a bear trap.""neither the rcmp, nor blackberry ever confirmed where the global key actually came from and the documents shed little light on the matter. they also didnt deny it.in fact, blackberry has recently signalled a willingness to deal with law enforcement on encryption, with company ceo john chen writing last year that ""we reject the notion that tech companies should refuse reasonable, lawful access requests.""""thats the reality of it, thats what we dont want the general public to know.""through the course of the trial, the defense managed to get the crown to admit that this wasnt just a key. it was the key. this was blackberrys global encryption key.many of the hearings about the global key happened on an ex parte basis, meaning that the defense counsel were not allowed to attend.crown prosecutors pulled out a variety of excuses as to why the information about the origin of the key, and the exact nature of blackberrys cooperation with the rcmp, should remain strictly private. in applications filed with the court, they cited privilege to avoid answering the courts questions on that matter. they argued that disclosing the involvement of blackberry may ""have a negative commercial impact on the company."" they claimed that admitting to blackberrys involvement could compromise the polices relationship with it, and other technology companies that may be called upon to help.at one point, the judge sided with the defense in ordering that the rcmp release the key itself to the defense, which would likely mean that the key — the one that can open millions of digital locks — would be released publicly. that request was later dropped.the idea of publishing the key was one that led blackberry to object.alan treddenick, director of national security and law enforcement liaison at blackberry, swore in an affidavit that if the court ordered the rcmp to hand over details about the encryption key, or the key itself, in its possession, it would ""potentially impact relationships with other end-users and law enforcement criminal investigations globally for all foreign countries that blackberry operates and provides communication services.""during the hearings, crown attorney robert rouleau asked rcmp inspector mark flynn: would the disclosure of this information about the global key jeopardize ongoing investigations?""we have several investigations ongoing right now, varying from individual homicides, organized crime homicides and organized crime and drug investigations occurring in various locations in canada today [where] our capabilities in this environment are a significant factor,"" flynn said, according to a 2015 transcript filed with the court.rouleau even admitted to the judge, during one ex parte hearing, that his own phone would be vulnerable to the type of intrusion the rcmp used on the targets of the investigation.""im a dead chicken. thats the reality of it, thats what we dont want the general public to know,"" rouleau said.""the exact same sorts of tools can be used in countries that dont have the same rule of law that we do.""the court did conclude that the global key was used by the rcmp. ""it is agreed by all parties that the rcmp would have had the correct global key when it decrypted messages during its investigation,"" reads a decision from judge stober. as defense lawyer michael lacy phrased it: ""you have to have the proprietary or intellectual property of rim/blackberry, wherever it comes from, in order to make sense of an encrypted pin to pin communication.""the court ultimately ordered the crown to disclose to the defense virtually everything about the global key and how they obtained it, save for the key itself. the crown appealed, and the next phase of the legal saga was scheduled for march 30, 2016.***on wednesday, march 30, the seven men accused of the murder walked into a courtroom in laval, just north of montreal. six pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder, and the seventh confessed to being an accessory after the fact.at almost exactly the same time, the lawyers fighting on their behalf to reveal the details of this global key walked past the giant stone columns of the quebec court of appeal in montreals old port and informed a three-judge panel that, in light of the pleas, the appeal would be discontinued. that means that judge stobers ruling, that the crown must disclose how blackberry cooperated to help the rcmp crack the suspects communications and how the rcmp obtained the global key, would never be fulfilled.photo via the associated press/eric risberglacy, one of the defense lawyer in the case, says the end of the appeal leaves a litany of unanswered questions.""there were documents that we filed on the motion that made it clear that rim is, and was, actively involved in facilitating the orders,"" he told vice news.what remains a mystery, he said, is how.""we were satisfied based on the evidence adduced at the hearing, and our own inquiries, that you had to have the actual global encryption key,"" he said. as to where it came from? ""thats very much an open question.""***blackberrys canadian and american offices declined to comment for this story. a spokesperson for rogers declined to address the case directly, instead sending a prepared statement stating that they protect their customers privacy and only cooperate with valid legal requests.minister of public safety ralph goodale would not speak to the specifics of the case or operation clemenza during a phone conversation with vice news, nor would he comment on the appropriateness of the rcmp obtaining the global decryption key, but did say he was familiar with the operation. citing the ongoing public debate in the united states over the fbis request to unlock the cellphone that belonged to the san bernardino shooters, goodale said that now is the time for discussions about encryption and privacy to be had.""where is the proper intersection, or boundary line if you will, between the proper requirements of public safety and the proper requirements of privacy? and where does society want to define that line, and that discussion has not been had yet?"" goodale said. ""that discussion has to be had.""goodale went on to say that his government will be introducing legislation to establish an independent parliamentary review committee for canadas intelligence collection services before the summer, although did not specify whether that body would also be tasked with overseeing the rcmp.the rcmp turned down an interview with someone from either of the units involved with operation clemenza, and declined to talk specifically about the operation or the blackberry global encryption key, but did send a statement regarding encryption in general.""using encryption to secure data and communications assists in crime prevention but may also inhibit the lawfully authorized interception of communications and evidence gathering in national security and criminal investigations,"" reads the rcmp statement. ""these are complex challenges which the rcmp continues to study. the rcmp encourages public discourse with canadians as public policy continues to take shape on the issue of encryption.""the statement goes on to detail how the rcmp can obtain wiretap warrants and intercept communications. ""however, there is no specific power in the criminal code to compel a third party to decrypt or develop decryption tools, nor is there any requirement for telecommunications services to provide these services,"" the statement concludes.lacy, the defense lawyer, calls that ""misleading."" he says the criminal code is rife with authorities to compel service providers to aid in investigations. he adds that its an ""open question"" as to whether the global key was handed over by court order.even so, the details revealed by the case are bad news for the company, which was once lauded as an industry leader in terms of privacy and encryption.""the exact same sorts of tools can be used in countries that dont have the same rule of law that we do,"" parsons, the citizen lab researcher, said. ""the fact that its a weak cryptographic system means that its a weak cryptographic system for everyone in the world.""in the end, after two years of wrangling over one of canadas most high-level and secretive surveillance programs, nobody will stand trial for firing the shot that killed salvatore montagna.follow justin ling and jordan pearson on twitter: @justin_ling & @neuwavestopics: crime & drugs, canada, americas, montreal, blackberry, decryption, encryption, pgp, pin-to-pin, ralph goodale, salvatore montagna, operation clemenza, surveillance",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1063304,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,None,151708,Exclusive: How Canadian Police Intercept and Read Encrypted BlackBerry Messages,115356

(as a reminder, its capacity must be at least 32 gb.) simply plug the flash drive into the computer before booting into the qubes installer from a separate installation medium, choose the flash drive as the target installation disk, and proceed with the installation normally. after qubes has been installed on the flash drive, it can then be plugged into other computers in order to boot into qubes. in addition to the convenience of having a portable copy of qubes, this allows users to test for hardware compatibility on multiple machines (e.g., at a brick-and-mortar computer store) before deciding on which computer to purchase. (see hcl-report for advice on hardware compatibility testing.) keep in mind to also change assigned devices for your netvm and usbvm, if you move between different machines..3.  there is also a live usb option available, which may be even easier for testing.4.   installing qubes in a virtual machine is not recommended, as it uses its own bare-metal hypervisor (xen).5.   macintosh pcs are not currently supported due to keyboard and mouse problems. (see #230 for details. patches welcome!)6.   advice on finding a vt-d capable notebook.take note  -  you will need a usb flash drive of at least 32gb in size to run qubes from. please also check the hardware compatibility list on the qubes website.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1063467,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,hacking tools,151884,Qubes,52941

0,False,Marketplaces ->Vendor Review,Medica,40,English,"tabs: 5 wow unperfcost: free sampleshipping: 36 hours;  a+stealth: a+purity/dosage: accurately laid around 100ugdescription: i contacted sirlucy about participating in his free sample and he was kind enough to accept me.  he noticed my pgp key in my signature and proactively messaged me using pgp with all necessary details.  i sent him my information and no lie received the package 36 hours later.  this is of course partly due to proximity of where he is and i am, but more importantly, it means he really has a streamlined, efficient shipping process to make it here that fast.  i have ordered over 20 times on the darknets and this was hands down the fastest shipment i have ever received and it wasnt even express shipping.stealth/packaging: the tabs would never, ever fall out or be damaged in any way.  they are protected from light, air, etc.  there was no decoy, but this was just a sample so i really didnt expect one nor do i think it is necessary for wow unperf tabs.accuracy/dosage:  sirlucy estimated the tabs to be in the 100-110 range for every 1/4"".  i used this as my benchmark and took approximately 3.8 tabs which should put me in the ~380-410ug range.  for comparison, i once took 4.5 tabs of ootp nola np and sirlucys tabs kicked their ass.  i always felt the ootp tabs were underdosed, but taking significantly less (0.7 tabs less) and feeling they were stronger, in addition to me being much more familiar with psychedelics since experimenting with ootps tabs (tripped at least 10 times since ootp and improved my set/setting procedures) makes me very, very confident in the dosage of sirlucys tabs.the trip: i took what i estimate to be around 400ug at 8:10a.m.  i held all four tabs in my mouth for about 30 minutes and noted my first perception change at 35 mins.  i usually get hit in the 30-40 min mark on high doses so this was spot on what i would expect with a dosage of 300-500.  i generally follow the medical/university type approach when i trip on high doses which means ambient music (no lyrics) and eyes closed as much as possible.  my mantra for this trip was:""be here, be still, be love, and let go..."" knowing that with a ~400ug dose the worst thing you can do is fight it.  i did not notice any body load or taste when taking the tabs but i suffer from back pain due to bad posture since i was a teenager, genetics, etc.  i immediately became so in tune with my senses at the 45min mark that i wrote a note to ""reclaim your body, eliminate your back pain.  do more yoga, take breaks at work, and improve your posture when sitting and standing"".  already a great lesson to integrate and not even an hour in !i soon became swallowed by the intensity of the trip and did not take any notes or try to be ""present"" for at least 2.5 hours.  i tried to let go as much as possible and i experienced my own version of ego-death.  i became awareness of all and became a ""whore"" who sold her body for money, became her john, became a heroin addict, became their dealer, and this continued through numerous humans in this world.  i experienced all their suffering, pain, loss, as well as their failed hopes, dreams, and desires.  i gained true sympathy and compassion for all those who are less fortunate.  after a couple of hours my neighbor took out some beer bottles and threw them in the recycling near my home.  i know they are an alcoholic (they drink every day all day) and i was sucked up into the vortex and became them and finally understood their suffering and pain and why they drink.  i got a little too sucked into their existence and started losing myself into negativity and could not escape their pain and this went on for what felt like hours but was only maybe 45-90 seconds.  i had to remind myself to ""let go"" and ride any wave that came instead of fighting it.  i noted after 3 hours:""jesus fucking christ.  this is an intense day.  you have already come face to face with heaven, hell, humanity, and suffering.""  i dont know if you believe in past lives, non-duality, or anything like that, but a high dose trip will certain make you experience them if they are real and you believe that or will be the most intense hallucination humanly possible.  i will leave my interpretation private and you can have your own as well.after experiencing so much suffering, i realized i was fighting the trip and it was making it difficult so i once again surrendered.  i now became numerous homeless people in my city.  i got to the core of their problems and realized that many of them have lost their faith in humanity and what it means to be a human.  i noted: ""dont simply ignore homeless people.  remind them they they are a person, they have a voice, that they are not forgotten, and they are not ignored"".  i believe that getting to their core being of being love will help many of them start recovering or at least give them hope, even if fleeting.  after this experience i was fully sucked into the ""non-duality"" concept of ego death and became all.  i was no longer me or a person and was the trees, the wind, the animals, and the people.  i came face-to-face with what enlightment is and realized that ""they are you, and you are them"".  we are all god, there is no divide.  most people look to god above, in the clouds as some creator of the human species only.  i believe that god is not above but ""below"", in the sense that ""god"" is everything.  the entire universe is god and we are all that same god.  there is no difference between anything/anyone and god is literally every subatomic particle all the way to the entire universe.  this was terrifying to experience to realize there is something so, so much more powerful than yourself.  in a sense, it reminds me of alex greys art in which there are eyeballs everywhere. that is a symbolic representation to deity and its ""allness"".  again, maybe im reading too much pantheism/non-duality before this spiritual dose/trip, but to personally experience it was nothing short of life changing.  i was reminded about 5-6 hours in that ""everything you need, you already have"", in the sense that you have everything inside of you to make yourself happy.  i went down some tangents from my non-duality/oneness part of the trip and went into a symbolic place i would describe as the apple/google business plan which made me realize just how much these big corporations have really locked into the human psyche and are masters at manipulating it.  from checking your email, to instagram, to being a news addict, etc.  anyways, at the end of the peak (now at 6 hours) i wrote ""never forget all the lives you experience, all their pain, loss, and suffering.  dont let it be for nothing!""  what i mean by this is to not ignore those who are less fortunate, to spend a portion of time helping (i volunteer after my last spiritual dose), and to not judge those for they are collection of their experiences and birth position.  the peak/epiphony period lasted a good 6 hours, most of my regular 200-300 doses peaks end by 4.5-5 hours so it was definitely close to 400ug.  i dont know how long the total trip lasted as once i pass the peak im usually ok, but at 10 hours i went out to a public park and was definitely still hyper sensitive to everything and was really that way into the night.to summarize it all: the vendor is amazing in every way.  in my opinion, they will be as big as tguk if they want to be with their quality service, price, and being domestic us.  or, they cant be as stellar as reximusmaximus if they simply want to provide amazing product/price/service but not be buried in work 24h a day.  that is their call, and either way, they will go down as a legendary vendor.  cheers to sirlucy for the amazing free opportunity and would recommend him to everyone and give him a 100/100 score.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1063502,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,hacking tools,151750,SirLucy's Palace ? 99.99% LSD ?

0,False,General Discussion ->Security,,40,English,"the following is taken from a clearnet article (link unknown) regarding the use of smart contracts (using the ethereum network) to incentivise tor usage and support. its a cut and paste from someone who sent it to me anonymously. i take no credit or responsibility for article. seems like a decent concept though. here goes:i’m a user of tor, the privacy protection software that slows the seemingly endlessforces of internet data collection. this past week, motherboard revealed thatcarnegie mellon university worked with federal agents to attack the privacyprotections of the tor network. while the attackers might argue these attacks werenecessary and limited, we have seen similar situations where the tools created to dogood things are co-opted to do not-so-good things.a brief overview of torthe internet works like a giant game of telephone. when two people want to exchangea message, one computer must send a message to a peer, which then sends the messageto its peer, and so on until it reaches the recipient.tragically for privacy, every step in that communication can suck up important“metadata” like the identities of the receiver and sender. this is a problem for allof us who are concerned with the vast swaths of personal data that might end up inthe hands of advertisers, data brokers, insurance companies, employers and othermalicious agents. the us navy realized it was an especially dangerous problem fordiplomats, armed services members, and pro-western activists overseas.in response to the threat of data collection, the us navy funded the design of anonion-routing protocol called tor. rather than passing messages between two users,it bounces messages between a number of proxies. each of these proxies can see whichproxy sent them a message and the next proxy, but they can’t see anything beyondthat. with the addition of multiple layers of proxies, the metadata needed to trackusers online gets stripped away.notably, the privacy of the tor network is dependent on maintaining a high layer oftraffic. if an attacker can see that alice sent a message at 3:24 and bob received amessage at 3:24, and if those are the only messages sent on the network that day, itis obvious they are communicating. in order to be effective, tor would have to be apublic network with a high level of organic traffic.however, to convince people to use the network, the navy would have to allow anyoneto run a proxy. few people would be comfortable relying on tor if they knew everyproxy was controlled by the us government. the reason for this is simple: if asingle actor controls multiple proxies in a single message pass, that actor canunilaterally track the messages’ metadata.in 2004, the naval research laboratory released the tor code under a free license.in 2006, the tor project began maintenance of the tor network as an independentnon-profit.tor’s fundamental weaknesswhile the privacy protections of tor require a large number of proxies, there existsno incentives for users to provide them. proxies are run mostly by volunteers orfunded by non-profits. without an incentive structure to support it, theinfrastructure is under-resourced, load times are slow, participation is diminished,and privacy protections are eroded.most troublingly, access to the internet via tor is frustratingly limited. siteowners mistake large amounts of traffic originating from a small number of proxiesas a denial of service attack. after all, why else would a single ip address begenerating the traffic of hundreds or thousands of average users? well intentionedsite owners often block or limit access to tor users, forcing them to completetime-consuming captchas with every page load.smart contracts and why we need themthe blockchain allows us to trustlessly and cheaply transfer value between twoparties that have never met. coupled with smart contracts, it is a revolutionarytool for incentivizing the proxies needed for a more private internet.rather than simply passing messages between proxies, we could pass messages bundledwith a micropayment transaction which, when submitted to the blockchain, compensatesproxies. in other words, instead of telling proxy a “please relay this message toproxy b”, we tell proxy a “please relay this message to proxy b and here’s .0001cfor your service.”if the blockchain was simply a value transfer system without smart contracts, such amicropayment system would be unfeasible. each single message pass would require ahalf dozen individual micropayments to be submitted to the blockchain. multiply thatby millions of users accessing hundreds of web pages a day and any blockchain wouldbe overwhelmed. luckily, smart contracts provide us with a way to trustlessly batcha large number of micropayments into a single transaction.how to bundle micropayments with smart contractsimagine alice is a privacy conscious individual and wants to use a proxy owned bybob. alice creates a smart contract on the blockchain and locks up a small amount ofvalue (~1usd). the rules of the smart contract are as follows:1.only bob may withdraw funds from this contract2.in order for bob to withdraw funds from the contract, he must provide a signedtransaction from alice3.once bob withdraws a portion of the funds, the rest is returned to alicethe third stipulation is perhaps the most important. it means that bob can onlywithdraw funds from the contract once. after the first withdrawal, the remainingfunds in the contract are automatically returned to alice.after alice deploys her smart contract on the blockchain for bob’s proxy, sherepeats the process for dozens of other proxies scattered across the globe. each ofthese smart contracts locks up a small amount of value (~$1usd) and has the exactsame rules.let’s say that alice, who happens to live in amsterdam, wants to send a message toellen in el salvador. now that alice has prepaid for the services of a number ofproxies, she is able to send messages privately. she plans a route for her messagethat goes like this:1.alice in amsterdam2.bob in boston3.charles in chile4.dan in duluth5.ellen in el salvadoralice then sends bob her message, bundled with a signed transaction that says:“bob may with withdraw .0001c from our contract. sincerely, alice.”bob then passes the message to charles, bundled with a signed transaction that says:“charles may with withdraw .0001c from our contract. sincerely, alice.”the process continues until it reaches ellen in el salvador.all the individual proxies, from bob to dan, may individually decide to submit theirsigned transaction to the blockchain. however, doing so would only release afraction of a cent from the contract?—?a small reward compared to the transactionfee required to submit it. rather than submit their transactions immediately, theproxy owners decide to wait, knowing that alice will likely want to use their proxyagain. after all, she has already prepaid ~$1usd, which she cannot unilaterallywithdraw.the next time alice wants to use any of the proxies, she includes a signedtransaction that says:“the proxy owner may with withdraw .0002c from our contract. sincerely, alice.”note that the new signed transactions release larger amounts from the contracts(.0002c versus .0001c). the proxy owners can now submit a single signed transactionand be compensated for both messages. this micropayment batching compensates proxiesfor passing messages while minimizing the strain on the blockchain.beyond privacywhile this post has focused on tor and private routing, tor is not the only routingsystem suffering from poor infrastructure incentives. the underlying internet isitself powered by a system of routers. this routing infrastructure is bothenormously expensive and naturally monopolistic, characterized by extremely highfixed costs and low marginal costs.in the developed world, this infrastructure works, but just barely. consumers payexorbitant fees to isps for low bandwidth, poor service, privacy violation, and toomuch junk mail. in the developing world, as well as in cases of natural disaster,political turmoil, and health pandemics, this infrastructure fails the people whoneed it most. large, centrally planned organizations do not have the local knowledgethat communities have and are prone to resource misallocation.the same smart contract systems which power a network of proxies could also be usedto power a network of routers. individuals could join together in a mesh to providethe backbone of a more resilient internet. micropayments at each route wouldincentivize users to contribute bandwidth. such a system would be the framework fora new, more resilient and more equitable internet.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1063538,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,None,151896,The Possibility of a Better Internet: Tor Smart Contracts and MicroPayments,94929

0,False,General Discussion ->Security,,40,English,"april 19, 2016 | by parker higginsapp store censorship and fbi hacking proposed at congressional crypto hearingtech experts and industry representatives squared off against law enforcement officials in two sessions of lively testimony today in front of the house energy and commerce committee. todays hearing is the latest in the ongoing battle in the courts and legislature commonly called the second “crypto wars,” after a similar national debate in the 1990s.two witnesses on the law enforcement panel offered a chilling proposal to deal with the well-documented weakness that any domestic encryption ban would do little against the hundreds of encryption products developed and sold internationally. thomas galati of the nypd and charles cohen of the indiana state police argued that software could be kept off american computing devices by exerting legal pressure on the android, apple, and blackberry app stores.that proposal would seem to leave to app store gatekeepers the nigh-impossible task of ensuring none of the software it carries comes with “warrant-proof” cryptographic options. but worse, it cuts right to the core of fundamental computing freedom questions and cues up the next legislative battle to address what software people are allowed to run on their devices.its a scenario envisioned by eff special advisor cory doctorow in his essay lockdown: as long as were using the kinds of general purpose computers that power our phones, laptops, and increasingly everything else, the only way to remove capabilities is by requiring drm software and other spyware to make sure users are in compliance.the laws that currently aim to enforce those kinds of restrictions piggyback on copyright law, and create uncertainty around phone jailbreaking, to pick a relevant example. eff has argued for—and won—explicit exemptions to those laws, allowing users to install software from alternative app stores. its not hard to imagine that if a proposal to regulate encryption software through app store chokepoints were to proceed, it would be accompanied by pressure to tighten those restrictions.at another point in the hearing, lawmakers pressed the fbis amy hess on the role of third-party “grey hat” hackers in accessing the data on the iphone at the heart of the hotly contested “apple v. fbi” case. representative diana degette of colorado suggested those capabilities might be cultivated internally instead.hess disagreed, saying the fbi will always need to seek the cooperation of industry and academic experts. that might have been an opportunity to discuss the duty fbi and other agencies have in disclosing vulnerabilities to those same tech industry companies—an area eff has worked to shine light on through freedom of information act requests and lawsuits concerning the vulnerabilities equities process (vep). unfortunately, no lawmakers pushed hess on the question.the second panel—made up of industry and tech representatives—seemed to serve as a fact-checking service for the first. apples general counsel bruce sewell, for example, categorically denied three allegations made about his company in the previous panel, saying apple has not provided source code to the chinese government, has not actively “thrown away” keys it once used to assist law enforcement, and has not announced passcode protection for the next generation of its icloud backup software.other irresponsible statements from the first panel went without comment. when charles cohen, the indiana state police commander, was asked about information that is more accessible to surveillance now than before cell phones, he drew a blank. “im having problems thinking of information that is available now that was not before. from my perspective, thinking through investigations that we previously had information for, when you combine the encryption issue along with shorter and shorter retention periods for internet service providers … it might be difficult to find an example of an avenue that is now available that was not before.” its possible that cohen is not familiar the myriad ways in which cell phone metadata, content, and location tracking are being used by law enforcement—but that would be quite a surprise, given the indiana state polices long history with the technology.ultimately, its a step forward that a congressional committee has summoned tech expertise into the room, if only to explain why law enforcement wasnt able to compromise our security in the first crypto wars. speaking to a representative who floated the idea of a key escrow system, university of pennsylvania associate professor of computer and information science dr. matt blaze explained: “i just want to caution that the split-key design, as attractive as it sounds, was also at the core of the nsa design of the clipper chip, which was where we started over two decades ago.” blaze should know; his research discovering a fatal flaw in the clipper chip protocol is often credited with sinking the project.meanwhile in the senate, draft legislation could threaten uncompromised cryptography altogether. u.s. readers, tell your senators to oppose the burr-feinstein backdoor proposal today.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1063640,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,None,151696,App Store Censorship and FBI Hacking Proposed at Congressional Crypto Hearing,18019

(this was our worst nightmare come true.) 2) it was also stated by many people, that everyone needed to use pgp, for the reason(s) listed above. one of the most common arguments i heard in response was that it really wasnt necessary, as the police wouldnt go after small buyers. well, now the other shoe has dropped.  the german police are going after small buyers, and anyone who failed to use pgp to protect themselves  may find themselves in a similar situation as the subject of this article. i hate to say ""i told you so!"" but i fucking told you so! zaphodgerman cops bust dude who bought weed on silk road years agowritten by joseph coxcontributormay 27, 2016 // 10:40 am esthttp://motherboard.vice.com/read/german-cops-bust-dude-who-bought-weed-on-silk-road-years-agowe’ve seen plenty of high profile and often technical busts on dark web sites targeting dealers, users, and administrators. in a recent case, german cops tracked down a marketplace user who placed orders for just a few grams of cannabis at a time, three years ago.a german user of the original silk road and another dark web market was recently fined over €3,000 for ordering cannabis 17 times, according to independent researcher gwern branwen. branwen said in a reddit post that the buyer contacted him recently. he also uploaded an apparent march 2016 letter from german law authorities detailing the transactions. (names and other information have been redacted from the letter, so motherboard was unable to contact its supposed recipient).according to the letter, the customers 17 purchases varied from 1.5 and 7.4 gram quantities of cannabis, between january and october 2013.plenty of dark web customers have been punished before. law enforcement often track down buyers of poisons or weapons and have also gone after buyers of “harder” drugs, such as mdma or methamphetamine.there have been a handful of marijuana cases.what makes this case stand out further is that police were still keen on tracking the buyer down years later; silk road was shut down way back in september 2013.it appears the customer—who told branwen he always encrypted his address when providing it to vendors—was identified after german authorities busted a cannabis seller who had kept records of all of their customers. from there, branwen thinks the police may have gone through records of the silk road server to find more of the customer’s purchases, since he consistently used one username.its not clear how the authorities would have discovered one of the customers orders from outlaw market, which is still running. the letter adds that “communications” from silk road were used.“can a buyer, in the absence of any intercepted packages or possession of illegal drugs, be prosecuted or otherwise get into trouble?” branwen writes on reddit. “at least in germany, the answer seems to be yes.”this case goes to show that even people who briefly used dark web markets may have to worry about law enforcement eventually tracking them down.topics: dark web, weed, cannabis, drugs, silk road, gwern branwen, gwern, cybercrime, germany",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1063978,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,hacking tools,151876,German Cops Bust Dude Who Bought Weed on Silk Road Years Ago,115356

""oh really, because you pgp-signed the message""ive seen vendors signing ads.  ive seen people signing forum posts.seriously people, stop pgp signing things.  signing things is for when its important to prove that you wrote something and that it hasnt been tampered with.  most of the time thats not necessary.  so stop doing it when it isnt necessary!  sending a message to a vendor like ""hey id like to buy some heroin"" is something that should be encrypted to the vendors pgp key and not signed by your key.  signing a message like that can only hurt you, not help you.stop unnecessarily signing things!proper security is a mindset, one which is about information management.  proving you are you is generally antithetical to proper information management in the setting of an anonymous marketplace.yes i agree.  there is a poster over on the sr forums who signs every post, even one word replys.   i mean, this is an anonymous forum so why sign?   ",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1064028,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,None,151903,The distrubing trend of PGP signing,116019

(frank gunn/canadian press)""narco trafficking, human trafficking, money laundering, kidnapping, crime against children, knowing you are stopping those things ... how do you not love doing something like that?"" said the insider.although blackberry still counts businesses and governments around the globe among its customers, the company has acknowledged that its smartphone marketshare has declined significantly in the face of competition from apple and android phones.in response to questions from cbc news, a blackberry spokesperson said it ""will not address the questions given the extremely sensitive nature of this process.""the company also provided a statement that said, ""blackberrys guiding principle has been to do what is right within legal and ethical boundaries when called upon to provide aid in the apprehension of criminals, or preventing government abuse of invading citizens privacy. we have long been clear in our stance that tech companies, as good corporate citizens, should comply with reasonable lawful access requests.""blackberry has recently defended its co-operation with law enforcement amid high-profile cases such as the standoff between apple and the fbi over access to an encrypted iphone, and heightened concerns about privacy and government surveillance in the wake of revelations from u.s. whistleblower edward snowden.""the snowden stuff, i have a problem with that. mass surveillance is an issue,"" another source said.""but when you have a company, following the law with checks and procedures in place, i feel good about that,"" the source said defending blackberrys approach.the public safety operations team at blackberrys headquarters has streamlined a process to deal with what insiders characterize as a flood of requests from police. lawyers review warrants and judicial authorizations before giving data analysts a green light to intercept and decrypt messages.the company has developed an international cover letter (icl) for police and government agencies to submit alongside a warrant.cbc news obtained a version of the cover letter, one used by italian authorities. it includes checkboxes for ""emergency/exigent/routine"" requests, to help blackberry prioritize life-threatening situations over routine investigations.3 categories of informationit offers a menu of three categories of information blackberry can provide:*   device, account, and subscriber data (including pin, imei, sim, blackberry id, name, address, payment, and purchase information).*   message transaction logs (times and dates of bbm and pin message exchanges, current bbm contact list).*   ""other.""multiple law enforcement and company sources tell cbc that the ""other"" section is where police detail requests to intercept and descramble user communications, including the consumer versions of its once popular bbm and pin-to-pin messaging services.the cover letter demands police sign a confirmation that their request is legal in their home country and affirm that it is ""made in connection with the enforcement, investigation, or prosecution of violations of publicly promulgated criminal laws ... and not the control, suppression, or punishment of peaceful expression of political or religious opinion.""insiders say blackberry will only consider requests if they include a valid legal order from the foreign jurisdiction.potential for abusechristopher parsons, a research associate at the university of torontos citizen lab, who has studied the privacy practices of tech companies, is worried by the secrecy of blackberrys process and its potential for abuse.""the concern would be that there is a lawful order from a corrupt judge,"" said parsons, who reviewed the icl for cbc news. ""there are countries in the world, unfortunately, where this does happen.""he said blackberry is allowing foreign police to bypass the mutual legal assistance treaty, a diplomatic agreement that allows canadian officials to review requests from foreign police and consider whether they are legal under canadian law.sidestepping the process""this is direct. this is a sidestepping of that entire process. this is blackberry being the one that makes that decision, as opposed to the canadian government,"" parsons said. he acknowledged that the treaty process can take months, so police likely prefer dealing directly with blackberry.u.s. law prohibits the likes of apple, facebook, and google from intercepting communications on behalf of foreign agencies, which parsons says contrasts to blackberrys practice.company insiders, meanwhile, say advances in encryption are making interception of mobile communications increasingly difficult for police. yet they also say they are surprised criminals have been slow to pick up on blackberrys co-operation with police to access messages.""they are making the mistake thinking its untouchable and nobody can see it ... not aware there is a group in canada that can access it, decrypt it and send it to law enforcement,"" said a source, who also says the team has a sense of ""mission"" helping law enforcement.""if you have the ability to help put bad people that have committed crimes behind bars, why not help someone do that? whats your counter-argument to putting bad guys away?""?please send tips to dave.seglins@cbc.ca or matthew.braga@cbc.ca or anonymously via cbc securedrop?.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1064102,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,data leak,151895,BlackBerry hands over user data to help police 'kick ass' insider says,115356

0,False,Marketplaces ->Vendor Review,,40,English,"delivery - ndd (every time but once).stealth - vacum sealed in mylor bag, and discrete post.product - really nice coke this, even though its bashed its very strong, it comes up nice and smooth with that great coke feeling warming over you, the need to redose takes a long time to come, as the effects last a good 20 - 40 mins off one line, if you stop you can eat and sleep normally, no horrible speedy effect, and best of all you wake up the next day not feeling rough but feeling uplifted. seriously i get no comedown off this coke and my nose is fine the next day.communication - has time for questions and seems a real nice guy.i only use shine69 for my coke needs now, i have tried many others on the dark web and i have been pleased and also disappointed but no one has had the stuff these guys have its top quality clean coke and its been the same since i used them on agora.",,2016-06-15,02:43:17,1064236,2016-06-15,02:43:17,02:43:17,2016-06-16,None,151748,Shine69 UK Coke vendor  (established since SR1) review thread,106455
